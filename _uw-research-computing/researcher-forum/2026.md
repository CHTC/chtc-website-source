## Community knowledge sharing

Members of the CHTC community have accumulated knowledge about research computing.
We want to help people share that knowledge with each other.

### Bioinformatics Café

This community-of-practice started Fall 2025 and brings together life-science researchers using CHTC resources.
Monthly meetings include tutorials and facilitation support.

For more information, see the [dedicated web page](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/bioinformatics-cafe).
**Beginners are welcome!**

### CHTC Community Forum

(Not to be confused with the Researcher Forum event!)

The facilitation team regularly get questions like "is there anyone else doing \_\_\_\_ on CHTC?" and "do you have any tips for doing \_\_\_\_?".
With the CHTC Community Forum, we hope to help users connect and share knowledge with each other.

Ask questions, share ideas, and search previous posts from other users to learn more about using CHTC to power your research.
This Community Forum also gives facilitators the opportunity to share more information and updates without spamming the full CHTC Users email list.

**To get started, login to [community.chtc.wisc.edu](https://community.chtc.wisc.edu) using your NetID.**

## Integrating data with computing

Research computing is at its best when empowered by real-world data, but getting that data to the computing can be a headache.
With the Pelican Platform, CHTC hopes to reduce this headache and streamline your research.

### CHTC and ResearchDrive

For a number of years, users have been able to [manually transfer](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/transfer-data-researchdrive) data to/from ResearchDrive and CHTC.
While useful, there's often a painful shuffling process when the amount of data in ResearchDrive exceeds the space we can provide on CHTC systems.

With the new "UWDF" integration with ResearchDrive, powered by the Pelican Platform, users can now declare in their submit files how each job should transfer data to/from ResearchDrive.
Input data in ResearchDrive is transferred automatically at the start of the job, while output data can be transferred back to ResearchDrive at the end of the job.

**To get started, [read the guide](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/htc-uwdf-researchdrive).**
We're also hosting a dedicated training on [April 7th](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/events/2026/04/07/ResearchDrive-on-CHTC). 

> Do you have a large volume of data **not** in ResearchDrive, and want a similar functionality for your HTCondor jobs?
> Let us know - we may be able to help!

## AI at CHTC

By leveraging the power of High Throughput Computing (HTC), we're working to make CHTC a key part of the campus ecosystem for AI support. 

### HTC and AI

HTC works best at executing many independent calculations. 
The AI research components best suited to this paradigm are

* inference workflows
* (hyper)parameter tuning
* dataset preparation
* feature extraction

While not well supported at this time, we are exploring how we can help users interested in interactive code development and testing.

### Facilitation and AI

While there is a plethora of training materials for AI research computing, few of them are easily translated to the HTC paradigm.
The facilitation team has been developing tutorials and guides for users interested in using CHTC for AI research computing.

* AlphaFold3 tutorial ([February 11](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/events/2026/02/11/AlphaFold3-on-CHTC)). [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10-UUBKlYnul6KslN5slFQyCEebI6a0tyZwlucis-ynQ/edit?usp=sharing). [Materials](https://github.com/CHTC/tutorial-CHTC-AF3).

* PyTorch tutorial ([March 25](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/events/2026/03/25/PyTorch-Training)).

In addition to our general facilitation support, we also have an expert facilitator who is willing to consult on AI workflows.

### GPUs at CHTC

Thanks to university funding, CHTC regularly purchases GPU servers to increase our open capacity.
For a list of the GPUs available in CHTC account, see the [table here](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/gpu-jobs#1-gpu-lab). 
These GPUs are available to anyone with a CHTC account, with the option to scale beyond the open capacity [as described here](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/scaling-htc).

## Improvements to HTCondor

[summary: HTCondor is the primary product of CHTC, we rely on user feedback to help improve, and changes improve the lives of researchers at CHTC and beyond.]

### Deployed

These features have been released and are ready to use.

* **new `shell` submit command** - users can now declare the command they want their job to execute, directly in the submit file. [CHTC guide](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/htcondor-job-submission#option-1-submit-with-shell). [HTCondor manual](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man-pages/condor_submit.html#shell).

* **new `retry_request_memory` submit command** - users can now provide a second, larger memory request for jobs that exceed the initial memory request, and HTCondor will automatically retry the job with the larger amount. [CHTC guide](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/variable-memory). [HTCondor manual](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man-pages/condor_submit.html#retry_request_memory).

* **improvements to `condor_watch_q` command** - users' favorite command for monitoring the progress of their jobs now shows when jobs are transferring files, and now accepts "any key" to exit.

### Active development

These features are being worked on and may have beta versions available for testing. 
**Contact the facilitation team if you are interested in testing.**

* **"common files" transfer** - users can declare a set of files that every job needs and HTCondor will automatically reuse said files across multiple jobs on the same machine.

* **tool for resource usage analysis** - users can see a summary report of the amount of resources their jobs actually used, to help optimize the amounts that they are requesting.

* **"remote submit"** - users can submit jobs directly from their own computer using Python.

### In design phase

These items are under consideration for future development.
**Contact the facilitation team if you are interested in participating in the conversation.**

* **"noun verb" commands interface** - users would be able to interact with HTCondor using an easier-to-learn set of commands that are more consistent with other CLI tools.

* **finer-grained declaration of file transfers** - users would be able to more easily declare multiple file transfers and mappings, while preserving backwards compatibility.

* **more support for interactive work** - users would be able to deploy interactive computing environments more easily.

*Disclaimer: these items are not guaranteed to be implemented.*

## Access compute from a browser

New users increasingly expect to be able to access their computing resources via a web browser.
We're working to support these users.

### HPC and Open OnDemand

Users of the High Performance Computing (HPC) "Spark" cluster can now access the system via Open OnDemand ([openondemand.org](https://openondemand.org)).
The current deployment is fairly bare-bones, but with enough interest, we may expand the deployment to include other features of Open OnDemand.

**To get started, [read the guide](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/ood.html).**

### BadgerCompute

In partnership with DoIT and the Data Science Institute, we've launched a Jupyter-based interactive computing service for researchers on campus.
Compute, visualize data, and write Jupyter notebooks without additional installation or leaving your laptop.

For more information on the service, see [badgercompute.wisc.edu](https://badgercompute.wisc.edu).

**To get started, [read the guide](https://badgercompute.wisc.edu/get-started/).**

## Facilitation improvements

Now at four full-time staff, the facilitation team continues to improve user support resources.

### Website updates

In the past year, we've

* revamped the website navigation
* streamlined guides on using containers
* added feature-specific guides

along with a variety of other small changes.

Looking forward, we're planning to add a "hello world" guide on how to build containers and to revamp the landing page for user guides.

**Check out the [CHTC Research Computing](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/index.html) website.**

### CHTC Recipes

We provide a central GitHub repository with examples of software containers and less common workflows, at [github.com/CHTC/recipes](https://github.com/CHTC/recipes).
In this past year, we added several more recipes, updated several others, and had our first user contributions.

Looking forward, we plan on adding more recipes and hope to pull in more user contributions!

### Bioinformatics support

In addition to the Bioinformatics Café discussed above, we're working to support bioinformatics researchers on campus and elsewhere.

The databases necessary for running AlphaFold3 have been populated on a lot of our open capacity servers on the HTC system, which means users no longer have to worry about hauling around 700+ GB of data for their AlphaFold jobs.
We're exploring how to make these databases available as part of the OSPool and considering what other bioinformatics databases we can host for users.

Bioinformatics research increasingly uses workflow managers Nextflow and Snakemake for executing data processing pipelines. 
We're investigating how we can support these programs on CHTC so that researchers can continue to use what they are familiar with.

## Save the dates - Summer 2026

In addition to our regular campus events, CHTC also hosts a couple of (inter)national events in support of research computing.

### HTC26

This year's Throughput Computing Week (HTC26) is being held June 9 - June 12 in Madison. 
Throughput Computing Week brings together researchers, campuses, international science collaborations, and more in a multi-day conference.
Learn what's new in HTC, how others employ the technologies to power their research, and connect with research computing professionals from diverse communities.

For more information, [see the announcement here](https://path-cc.io/events/2026/06/09/throughput-computing-week/).

### OSG School 2026

The OSG School is a week-long summer school where researchers (and research staff) learn how HTC systems work and how they can apply tools like HTCondor and the OSPool to their own research or campus.

This year, the School is **July 13 - July 17**. 

**Applications are now open, due March 20**.
Visit [osg-htc.org/school-2026](https://osg-htc.org/school-2026/) to learn more.

## Keynote speaker: Ariana Negreiro

## Share your feedback

We want to hear from you!

We are strong adherents to the philosophy of "translational computer science", which means that a lot of our work is based on user feedback.
We are particularly interested in addressing "pain points" - things that are difficult, things that don't work the way you expect, and things that you wish were easier.
(We're also happy to celebrate your successes for things that work well!)

Please feel free to [reach out to the facilitation team](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/get-help.html) with your feedback!
