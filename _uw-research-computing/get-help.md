## Get An Account

If you don't have an account yet, please fill out our [Request
Form](form.html), and we'll follow up quickly to set up a meeting time
and create accounts. If you don't have an account but just have general
questions, feel free to send an email to chtc@cs.wisc.edu (see below).

## Request a Quota Change

If you'd like to request a change in your quotas for one of our data
storage locations, please see our [Request a Quota Change](quota-request) guide.

## Help Via Email

We provide support via email at the address
[chtc@cs.wisc.edu](Mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu), and it's never a bad idea
to start by sending questions or issues via email. You can typically
expect a first response within a few business hours.

When emailing us for assistance in troubleshooting an issue, please provide which system you are using, 
an explanation of what you expected to happen versus what actually happened, and  
include relevant files (or provide the locations of them on the system), such as:

* The job submit file (.sub)
* The job executable (.sh) or list of commands used in an interactive job
* Standard error and standard output files (usually .out or .err)
* If on the HTC system, the HTCondor log file (.log)

We will use this information to give you more effective responses and solutions.

<!-- For users who already have accounts, we have drop-in office hours on:

-   **Tuesday/Thursday afternoons, from 3:00 - 4:30 pm.**
-   **Wednesday morning from 9:30 - 11:30 am**

Office Hours are located in the [Discovery
Building](http://map.wisc.edu/s/919bjy8v) at the second-floor round
table, just off of the main staircase.\
 **For researchers without access to the upper floors of the Discovery
Building, check in at the front desk and ask them to "call CHTC."**\
 We will confirm that you are here for office hours and you will be let
upstairs. (Note: If you ask the desk to call for a facilitator, by name,
no one will answer as facilitators will not be in their *own* offices
during Office Hours.) --> 

## Make an Appointment

We are happy to arrange meetings outside of designated Office Hours, per
your preference. Simply email us at the address above, and we will set
up a time to meet!
