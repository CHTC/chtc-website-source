## Get An Account

If you don't have an account yet, please fill out our [Request
Form](form.html), and we'll follow up with your account details 
or a request to meet. If you don't have an account but just have general
questions, feel free to send an email to chtc@cs.wisc.edu (see below).

## Request a Quota Change

If you'd like to request a change in your quotas for one of our data
storage locations, please see our [Request a Quota Change](quota-request) guide.

## Help Via Email

We provide support via email at the address
[chtc@cs.wisc.edu](Mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu) and this is a good, 
general way to reach us. You can typically
expect a first response within 1-2 business days. 

When emailing us for assistance in troubleshooting an issue, please provide which system you are using, 
an explanation of what you expected to happen versus what actually happened, and  
include relevant files (or provide the locations of them on the system), such as:

* The job submit file (.sub)
* The job executable (.sh) or list of commands used in an interactive job
* Standard error and standard output files (usually .out or .err)
* If on the HTC system, the HTCondor log file (.log)

We will use this information to give you more effective responses and solutions.

## Check System Status

We have a system status page at [https://status.chtc.wisc.edu](https://status.chtc.wisc.edu) that we 
use to provide updates 
about CHTC system issues, including outages and scheduled maintenance. Major outages and maintenance 
issues are still communicated via the `chtc-users` email list, but minor issues and updates to 
ongoing issues will be communicated via the status page. 

* If you are experiencing an issue with the system, please check the status page! If you 
don't see a corresponding incident, feel free to email us.

## Make an Appointment

We are happy to arrange meetings outside of designated Office Hours, per
your preference. Simply email us at the address above, and we will set
up a time to meet!
