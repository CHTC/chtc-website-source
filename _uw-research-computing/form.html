<p>Please fill out the below form in order to provide us with 
information about the large-scale computing work you would like 
to do (to the best of your knowledge). If you are unsure of an answer to a 
below question, leave the question blank or indicate that you don't know.</b></p>

<p>After filling out this form, CHTC Facilitation staff will follow up to 
create your account and offer times for an initial consultation. The consultation 
is only mandatory for new groups to CHTC, but we strongly encourage anyone who 
is getting started to take advantage of this valuable opportunity to discuss your 
work one-on-one with a CHTC Research Computing Facilitator. </p>
