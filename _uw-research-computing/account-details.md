The following sections detail the processes for requesting a new CHTC account, 
or for continuing to use an existing CHTC account. Use of CHTC services are free 
to use in support of University of Wisconsin - Madisonâ€™s research and teaching mission.

## Current Member of UW - Madison

If you are a current student, staff, or faculty at UW - Madison, you can request an account
by completing the [Account Request Form](form.html). A staff member from CHTC will follow
up with next steps. 

All accounts require an active NetID and a faculty sponsor (typically the PI that is leading 
your research project.)

## Graduating from UW - Madison

We understand that some users may need to continue carrying out their computational 
analyses after graduation and the subsequent expiration of their NetID. 

Once you are no longer enrolled in or employed by the University, you can continue
to use your CHTC account as an "External Collaborator". Follow the instructions in
the section below to have your faculty advisor sponsor your continued access to
CHTC.

**We highly recommend reaching out to CHTC staff before your NetID expires, if possible.**

* Our policy is that CHTC accounts are deactivated and user data is erased after a user 
is no longer actively using their account (~1 year of inactivity). It is your responsibility
to maintain your data and important files in a location that is not CHTC's file systems.

## External Collaborator

If you are not a current member of UW - Madison, you can gain access to CHTC provided
that you are sponsored by a faculty member of UW - Madison. To begin the account
request process, have your Faculty Sponsor email CHTC (chtc@cs.wisc.edu) and provide:

1. Your name,
2. The reason you need (continued) access to CHTC resources,
3. The amount of time they would like to sponsor your account,
4. Your city/country of residence, and 
5. Your institution. 

CHTC staff will then follow up with next steps to create or extend your account. 

* Your faculty sponsor can sponsor your account for up to one year at a time. If 
you need continued access past one year, your faculty sponsor must contact us and 
re-confirm that you should have continued access. 
* Our policy is that CHTC accounts are deactivated and user data is erased after a user 
is no longer actively using their account (~1 year of inactivity). It is your responsibility
to maintain your data and important files in a location that is not CHTC's file systems.
