While our High Throughput system has little in the way of pre-installed software, 
we've created resources to help users set up the software they want to use for running their jobs.

## CHTC Recipes Repository

CHTC provides examples for software and workflows for use on our systems in our "Recipes" repository on Github: 
[https://github.com/CHTC/recipes](https://github.com/CHTC/recipes).

## Containers

Many of the recipes in our Recipes repository involve building your own container. 
In this section, we provide a brief introduction into how to use containers for setting up your own software to run on the High Throughput system.

### Container Types

#### Docker

#### Apptainer

### Find an Existing Container

### Build Your Own Container

## Python

To use Python 3 on the HTC system, use an existing container or build your own with the version and packages that you want to use.
