<h1>Who We Are</h1>

We are the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s core computational resource provider for large scale computing. UW-Madison staff, students, faculty, and external collaborators are welcome to use the Center for High Throughput Computing's (CHTC) resources to carry out their computationally-intensive research. 

CHTC provides a variety of resources and tools to meet the demands of the University’s research community. 

We provide no-cost compute resources (CPUs/GPUs, high-memory servers, etc.), as well as no-cost personalized consultations and classroom support. 


<h1>Your Home for Research Computing is Here</h1>

As a leading research institution, UW-Madison needs a leading research computing center. Established in 2006, the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC), aims to bring the power of High Throughput Computing (HTC) to all fields of research and to allow the future of HTC to be shaped by insight from all fields. To advance this mission, the CHTC provides researchers access to state-of-the-art High Throughput Computing and High Performance Computing systems, as well as tools for data management and specalized hardware. 

Beyond CHTC's compute resources, CHTC’s Research Facilitation team helps researchers of all backgrounds identify their needs for large scale computing, practice skills needed to do their work, and provide support for implementing workflows.

They offer the following services, free-of-charge:
• Office Hours twice a week
• Personal consultations to provide individualized guidance
• Workshops and other informational events
• Yearly week-long HTC summer school
• Guest presentations for courses, seminars, and other groups
• Email support
