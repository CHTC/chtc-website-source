**If you have not yet requested a CHTC account and met with a Research
Computing Facilitator, please fill out [this form](form.html).**

This page lists important policies and expectations for using CHTC computing and 
data services. Our goal is to provide services that work well for **all users**, 
enabling us to support as much of campus as possible. If an individual user is taking 
action that negatively impacts our services, we reserve the right to 
deactivate their account or remove files without notice. 

## Access and Use

Use of CHTC services are free to use in support of UW - Madisonâ€™s research and 
teaching mission.

Accounts are linked to individuals and should NOT be shared. We are happy to make new
accounts for individuals or group-owned spaces for sharing files. Accounts that we 
notice being shared will be immediately disabled and a meeting with the PI 
(faculty advisor)may be necessary to reinstate the account.

## Data Policies

**CHTC data locations are not backed up**, and users should
treat CHTC compute systems as temporary storage locations for *active*,
currently-queued computational work. Users should remove data from CHTC
systems upon completion of a batch of computational work and keep copies of
all essential files in a non-CHTC location. CHTC staff reserve the right
to delete data from any CHTC data location at at any time, to preserve
systems performance, and are not responsible for data loss or file system
corruption, which are possible in the absence of back-ups.

**Note: CHTC is not HIPAA-compliant** and users should not bring HIPAA data into 
CHTC services. If you have data security concerns or any questions about 
data security in CHTC, please get in touch! We'll be happy to discuss.

## User Expectations

Because our systems are shared by many CHTC users, everyone contributes to 
helping the systems run smoothly. The following are some initial best practices 
to get the most out of CHTC without harming other users. Our goal 
is always to help you get your work done - if you think the following recommendations 
limits your capacity to run work, please contact us to discuss alternatives. 

**Never run computationally intensive tasks on the login nodes** for either 
system. As a rule of thumb, anything that runs for more than a few seconds, or 
is known to use a lot of cores or memory should not be run directly, but as a job. 
Small scripts and commands (to compress data, create directories,
etc.) that run within a few minutes on the submit server are okay,
but their use should be minimized when possible. If you have questions about this, 
please contact the facilitation team. CHTC staff reserve the right to kill any long-running or problematic processes on the 
head nodes and/or disable user accounts that violate this policy

**Avoid unsupervised scripts on the login nodes.** Automating tasks via tools like 
`cron` or using a workflow manager on the login node is not allowed without prior 
discussion with the facilitation or infrastructure team. 

**(HTC system specific): Do not run `watch` with `condor_q`**. The `condor_q` command 
is sufficiently complex that running it with the `watch` command can impair queue 
performance for everyone. Use `condor_watch_q` as an alternative that is more 
efficient. 

**Test your jobs**. We recommend testing a small version of your overall workflow 
before submitting the "real thing" for many reasons: 

- confirming how long the job(s) will run
- confirming the size and number of input and output files and whether your quota is accurate
