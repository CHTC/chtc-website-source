1. Use CHTC resources *only* for **research** or **approved courses**.
1. Have a **faculty sponsor**. This is typically the Principal Investigator (PI) of your research group or your course instructor.


## External collaborators

UW-Madison faculty members can sponsor accounts for external collaborators (including graduating students). Faculty members must email us at [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu) with the following information:

2. Reason for (continued) access to CHTC resources.
3. Length of time to sponsor the account (up to 1 year, can be renewed)
4. City/country of residence of external collaborator
5. Institution of external collaborator

## Use CHTC for a course

Do you need computing for your class? We can provide class accounts and support your class with guest presentations. Instructors should [email us](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu) to inquire about how we can support your class!
