For a Grant Proposal
--------------------

The UW-Madison maintains multiple compute clusters (including the largest of these operated by CHTC) across campus that are managed using either HTCondor or SLURM with support from CHTC. These clusters are connected by HTCondor technology to share resources with each other and with other institutions around the world via [OSG services](https://osg-htc.org/). Local computing capacity directly enabled by CHTC includes:

- High-Throughput Computing (HTC) resources totaling about 30,000 CPU cores in support of research. Temporary file space for large individual files can support up to hundreds of terabytes of total working data. For single computing runs needing significant memory on a single server, the CHTC maintains several multi-core servers with terabytes of memory.

  - When on-campus resources are fully utilized, CHTC leverages [OSG services](https://osg-htc.org/) to provision additional opportunistic resources from multiple external sites.

- A High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster consisting of roughly 7,000 tightly coupled cores. Compute nodes have 16 or 20 cores each, and 64 or 128 GB RAM, and are networked with 56 Gbps Infiniband, with access to a shared file system and resources managed via Slurm.

- An origin server where users can make research data available through the [Open Science Data Federation](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf.html) and an on-campus cache server which allows external jobs to cache files locally.

In the last year, CHTC made possible the use of more than 19,000 core years of computing work for campus researchers, supporting 328 projects across a wide range of research domains. Temporary storage space for large files can support up to hundreds of terabytes of total working data. Should these resources not be sufficient for the project, the CHTC can also engage computing resources from across the campus grid and the [OS Pool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html), an NSF-supported and expanding alliance of more than 100 universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations, and software developers.

The UW–Madison network currently comprises a 200Gbps backbone and WAN connectivity with 160Gbps to the Discovery building. The equipment is located on the “Research Backbone Network”, which allows for friction-free (e.g., no middlebox devices such as firewalls on the data path) to the nation’s research and education networks. Redundancy is built into the network and its supporting infrastructure. An equitable funding model assures that network resources are kept current. The UW has been fundamental to the establishment of the Broadband Optical Research Education And Science network (BOREAS). This Regional Optical Network (RON) connects to the CIC OmniPoP in Chicago, providing a high-speed gateway to various research networks, including Internet2, ESNet, CERN, and other global research networks. BOREAS, along with our participation in the Northern Tier Network Consortium, provides various options to connect at very high speeds to research partners with shared or dedicated bandwidth
