Welcome to CHTC!

This guide provides a roadmap to help you get started with our High Throughput Computing (HTC) system. 
The roadmap provides a series of steps that you can follow to translate your research computing from the small-scale (your computer) to the large scale (the HTC system). 
The goal is to help you create a HTC workflow that runs potentially hundreds or thousands of calculations with a single job submission!
