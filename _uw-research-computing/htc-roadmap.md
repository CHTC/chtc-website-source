<br>
Our “Software Solutions” guides contain information about how to install and use software on the HTC system.
<br>
<br>
<b>Software Containers</b>
In general, we recommend installing your software into a "container" if your software relies on a specific version of R/Python, if your software has many dependencies, or if it already has a pre-existing container (which many common software packages do). There are many advantages to using a software container; one example is that software containers contain their own operating system, users with software containers have the most flexibility with where their jobs run on CHTC or the OSPool.

<b>Use Pre-installed Software in Modules</b>
CHTC's infrastructure team has provided a limited collection of software as modules, which users can load and then use in their jobs. This collection includes tools shared across domains, including COMSOL, ANSYS, ABAQUS, GUROBI, and others. To learn how to load these software into your jobs, visit ______.

<b>Access Software Building Tools: Log into Software Building Machines</b>
The HTC system contains several machines designed for users to use when building their software. These machines have access to common compilers (e.g., gcc) that are necessary to install many software packages. To learn how to submit an interactive job to log into these machines to build your software, see _____.  

Conda environments: It is possible to install software using miniconda.
