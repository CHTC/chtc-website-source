# Access CHTC Resources after Graduation

We understand that some users may need to continue carrying out their computational analyses after graduation and the subsequent expiration of their NetID. 

To maintain access to CHTC resources after you leave your position at the University, your faculty advisor can sponsor continued access to CHTC resources and your NetID. 

The process for requesting an extension on your CHTC account and NetID is listed below: 

## **Step 1**

Your Faculty Sponsor should email CHTC (chtc@cs.wisc.edu) and provide:

  (1) Your name, 
  <br>  (2) The reason you need continued access to CHTC resources,
  <br> (3) The amount of time they would like to sponsor your account,
  <br> (4) Your new city/country of residence, and 
  <br> (5) Your new institution. 

* Your faculty sponsor can sponsor your account for up to one year at a time. If you need continued access past one year, your faculty sponsor must re-confirm that you can have continued access. 

## **Step 2** 

CHTC is required to verify that all individuals residing outside the United States be approved for access by the University’s Export Control office. This process takes approximately one week. 

## **Step 3**

Assuming there are no concerns about your access, CHTC staff will follow up when your CHTC account and NetID have been reactivated.  

## **Recommendations** 
* We highly recommend reaching out to CHTC staff before your NetID expires. The longer your NetID has been expired, the more difficult it is for CHTC staff to reactivate it. In some cases, it may be required to create a new NetID.
* As a reminder, CHTC accounts are deactivated and user data is erased after a user is no longer actively using their account (~1 year of inactivity). It’s important to always maintain a copy of your data somewhere else, especially if you may need to revisit it after graduation (e.g. manuscript revisions).
