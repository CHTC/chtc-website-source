----------------

This research was performed using the compute resources and assistance
of the UW-Madison Center For High Throughput Computing (CHTC) in the
Department of Computer Sciences. The CHTC is supported by UW-Madison,
the Advanced Computing Initiative, the Wisconsin Alumni Research
Foundation, the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, and the National
Science Foundation, and is an active member of the Open Science Grid,
which is supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S.
Department of Energy\'s Office of Science.\

The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) campus is an excellent
match for meeting the computational needs of this project. Existing
UW-Madison technology infrastructure supported by the CHTC can be
readily leveraged, including CPU capacity, network connectivity, storage
availability, and middleware connectivity. But perhaps most important,
the UW-Madison has significant staff experience and core competency in
deploying, managing, and using computational technology. The
UW-Madison\'s Advanced Computing Initiative (ACI) has invested in the
CHTC as the primary provider of shared large-scale computing
infrastructure to campus researchers, and all standard CHTC services are
provided free-of-charge to campus researchers, with rarely-necessary
options for researcher purchases of dedicated hardware (determined on a
case-by-case basis).\
\
For high-throughput computing (HTC) capability, UW-Madison maintains
many compute clusters across campus, which are managed via software
developed by the UW-Madison\'s HTCondor Project distributed computing
research group; therefore, these clusters are linked together to share
resources via widely adopted distributed computing technologies.
Together these clusters represent roughly 30,000 CPU cores in support of
research. In 2017, CHTC supported more than 380 million CPU hours of
computing work for campus researchers. Temporary file space for large
individual files can support up to hundreds of terabytes of total
working data. For single computing runs needing significant memory on a
single server, the CHTC maintains several multi-core servers terabytes
of memory. Should these resources not be sufficient for your project,
CHTC users can also engage computing resources from the Open Science
Grid (OSG), also at no cost to researchers. OSG is an expanding,
NSF-funded alliance of more than 120 universities, national
laboratories, scientific collaborations, and software developers, and
CHTC users have automatic access to OSG\'s considerable computing and
storage resources. Individual users of our high throughput computing
(HTC) system, including Open Science Grid capacity, can frequently
obtain in excess of 200,000 CPU hours per day.\
\
For high performance computing (HPC) capability, the CHTC also maintains
a shared-use cluster of roughly 7000 tightly coupled cores. Compute
nodes have 16 or 20 cores, each, and 64 or 128 GB RAM, with access to a
shared file system and resources managed via the open-source software,
SLURM. This cluster, deployed in June 2013 and expanded significantly in
summer 2014, delivered more than 50 million CPU hours in 2017. The
current configuration of this cluster is the result of intimate
collaborations with UW-Madison\'s Advanced Computing Initiative (ACI)
and fellow computing centers at other campuses through the NSF-funded
ACI-REF project.\
\
Between the ACI, CHTC, and aforementioned HTCondor Project, UW-Madison
is home to over 20 full-time staff with a proven track record of making
compute middleware work for scientists. Far beyond just being familiar
with the deployment and use of such software, UW staff has been
intimately involved in its design and implementation. Furthermore, the
CHTC provides consulting for the development of robust HTC and HPC
research methods, support for grant proposal development, and a variety
of formal and informal training opportunities for users of CHTC
resources.\

(Other campus resources you may wish to write about:)\
\
To collaborate with off-campus collaborators, and when local UW-Madison
compute resources are not sufficient, grid middleware connectivity
becomes essential. In this area, UW-Madison is an active participant in
NSF XSEDE activities, is the lead institution for the NSF-funded Open
Science Grid, and runs a Tier-2 computing center for the international
CMS LHC experiment.\
