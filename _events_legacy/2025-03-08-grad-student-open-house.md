All admitted UW-Madison CS students for the MS/PhD program are invited to join us at the Center for High Throughput Computingâ€™s Open House as a part of the Welcome Weekend. Students will have the opportunity to meet CHTC facilitators and learn about how CHTC supports researchers and educators at the graduate level and beyond via computational services, increased capacity, GPUs, and more. We will also highlight how we use feedback from users to guide the development of high throughput computing tools and practices.

Last year, CHTC supported 312 projects, using over 34K HTC Core Years and 6K HPC Core Years. CHTC manages over 20,000 cores and dozens of GPUs for the UW-Madison campus; this shared resource comes at no cost to UW-Madison researchers.
