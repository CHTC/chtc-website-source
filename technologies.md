desc="A data transfer service, [Pelican](https://pelicanplatform.org) facilitates the ability for researchers to access and transfer data from where it is stored to where it needs to run. Inspired by the 2022 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) proposition to make all government funded research data publicly accessible, Pelican works to efficiently transfer this open data to researchers who require it. Pelican provides an open-source software platform for federating dataset repositories together and delivering the objects to computing capacity such as the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/ospool)."
