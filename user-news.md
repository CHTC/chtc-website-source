## COVID-19 research; Thurs (4/23) office hour canceled; Gluster deletion
### Monday, April 20, 2020
<br/>
Greetings CHTC users,

We have a series of updates for your Monday!

**Office hours are canceled this Thursday (4/23) **due to prior commitments for CHTC's research computing facilitators. You can normally join office hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3 - 5pm at [go.wisc.edu/chtc-officehours](http://go.wisc.edu/chtc-officehours). We will still have office hours this Tuesday (4/21) and continue as usual next week.


**Do you have computing and/or data needs for research relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic?** If so, please get in touch at [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu). We'll follow up to discuss your objectives and how CHTC or other relevant resources might help.

**Files on Gluster to be deleted**: as [previously announced](https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/chtc-users/2020-March/msg00001.shtml), we are retiring the Gluster file share previously used for large data staging and software modules on the HTC system. As of today (4/20), files and software in Gluster are unavailable and will be deleted shortly.

Email [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu) with any questions or concerns.

Cheers,

Your CHTC team

## CHTC Website Content Now in GitHub
### Wednesday, January 08, 2020
<br/>
Happy New Year!


**We'd like to announce that the [CHTC website](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) content (including online guides) are now [hosted publicly in a GitHub repository](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source).** Among other plans for improving the website over the coming year, we have made this change to make it easier for the extended CHTC community to contribute and suggest changes to page content.

**Therefore, we'd like to formally invite YOU to contribute to the CHTC website in the following ways:**

1. Especially, because we're still transitioning the source file format for each page (from raw .shtml to Markdown), **you can let us know if you see any formatting problems we haven't caught** by emailing [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu) (as always), or for GitHub enthusiasts, describe the problem as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source/issues) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source/pulls) with the correction.
2. **You can otherwise contribute typo fixes, content clarifications, and content suggestions via GitHub issues and pull requests!** (Or, continue to report any thoughts in email to [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu), at office hours, etc., per your preference.)

We look forward to getting more of your input for the CHTC website!  
Your CHTC Team
