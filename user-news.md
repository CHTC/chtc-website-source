## HPC Cluster downtime on Tuesday, April 27
### Tuesday, April 20, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

_This message is for users of our high performance computing (HPC) cluster._

In order to incorporate new hardware, update network switches, and perform other general maintenance, **there will be an HPC Cluster downtime on Tuesday, April 27**, starting at 9:00am, and expected to last up to 6 hours. 

To prevent jobs from being interrupted by the downtime, we are currently draining jobs from all cluster nodes. **Submitted jobs requesting 7 days (or any time request that cannot be completed by April 27) will not start until the downtime is complete.** Jobs can still run on the cluster, but only if their time request (“--time=” in the submit file) indicates that they will complete before next Tuesday, April 27. 

We will send a reminder about the downtime on Monday, April 26, and a confirmation when the cluster is back up on April 27. Please contact us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions and concerns. 

Best, 
Your CHTC team
