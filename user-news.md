## Limited email responses, no office hours on Thursday, June 17, new website look!!
### Wednesday, June 16, 2021

Greetings CHTC users,

Two announcements for your Wednesday morning!

1. CHTC staff will be out of the office tomorrow, Thursday, June 17, for a staff retreat. Office hours are canceled and we will not be responding to email. **Please continue to contact chtc@cs.wisc.edu with questions and we will respond on Friday when we are back in the office.**

1. Our website has a new look! Check it out in the same location: chtc.cs.wisc.edu
    All of the underlying content (guides, reference pages) is the same, so you can access all the same information, just with a new appearance.
    This is also a reminder that the source code for our website is on [Github](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source), so if you have suggestions or contributions, you can open an issue or submit a pull request.

Best,
Your CHTC Team

## HPC Cluster back up today (6/9)
### Wednesday, June 9, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

*This message is for users of our high performance computing (HPC) cluster.*

The HPC cluster is back up after completing maintenance to its file system. 

Users should now be able to log in to the HPC cluster login nodes. All previously submitted jobs are still in the queue and will re-run automatically. We recommend that users with jobs that were running at the start of the downtime examine their output files for potential issues caused by the interruption of jobs. 

Please email us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any follow up questions or additional concerns. 

Best,

Your CHTC team

## HPC Cluster unplanned downtime starting now, possibly through next week (6/11)
### Friday, June 4, 2021

Greetings CHTC users,

This is an urgent message for users of our HPC Cluster.

We apologize for the lack of detailed update until now. While we thought the HPC Cluster filesystem had been repaired to stability early yesterday afternoon and had some specific users doing some tests, we discovered at the end of yesterday (just before we would have sent a positive update) that the issues had returned. **It appears that the filesystem will need more extended maintenance work, which we are beginning ASAP and hope to complete by sometime next week.**

**As of now, we need to take the following steps to prevent further issues until the downtime has ended:**

- users will not be able to log into the HPC Cluster until the TBD completion of the downtime
- running jobs will be re-queued, and so will remain in the queue until users can log in again
- jobs queued but not yet running will also remain in the queue

Additional details:

- While we plan to complete the maintenance work next week, this timeline is subject to change and we'll notify users as soon as we can.
- At this time we expect that all user data in the filesystem (i.e. /home and /software locations) will be preserved. The issue appears to be with the filesystem’s metadata (which keeps track of which data is where in the filesystem).
- If you have imminently urgent work delayed by this downtime, please get in touch ASAP to discuss.

As always, please email us with any questions or issues via chtc@cs.wisc.edu

Thank you for your patience,

Your CHTC Team
