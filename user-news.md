## CHTC holiday availability

### Wednesday, December 18, 2019


Greetings CHTC users,

This is an annual reminder that CHTC staffing will be limited at various points during the next week or so: 

- **Office Hours are cancelled for next week through Jan 1** (Dec. 23-27, Dec 30-Jan 1), and email responses will be delayed during this time as well. 
- Normal office hours and email response times will resume on Thursday, January 2nd

Please remember that your work on CHTC's shared compute systems affects other 
researchers. You should review and continue to follow CHTC policies for 
our [HTC System](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/use-submit-node) and
[HPC Cluster](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/HPCuseguide.shtml) to
 ensure that you are acting in consideration of others, especially since
 CHTC staff may not be able to respond as quickly to user-caused issues.
 
 As always, the best way to get in touch with us is through our designated email 
 address (chtc@cs.wisc.edu).
 
 Best wishes during the holiday season!
 
 Christina, Jess, Lauren, and the rest of the CHTC team
