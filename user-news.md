Greetings CHTC users, 

Due to limited facilitator ability, office hours this Thursday (July 15) are cancelled. We will still have office hours this week on Tuesday (July 13). 

On Monday, July 19, responses to our main email address (chtc@cs.wisc.edu) will be limited, as we are participating in an event. 

Best,

## CHTC office hour changes; staff out on Monday, July 5
### Tuesday, June 29, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

Office hours are now shortened slightly - instead of running from 3 - 5pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, they will end at 4:45pm. This change is also reflected on the CHTC website and [Get Help](/get-help) page.

Our facilitation team will be out of the office on Monday, July 5 for observance of the July 4th holiday. 

Best,
The CHTC facilitation team
