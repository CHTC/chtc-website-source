## Certain execute nodes shut down
### Wednesday, May 12, 2021

Greetings CHTC users,

There was a short chilled water interruption this morning, leading to the shut off of 5 HTC System execute nodes, and 20 HPC Cluster execute nodes.

We expect that the impacted servers will be back up within the next day, but jobs running on these will have been interrupted and may require action from users:

* In the HTC System, these jobs are automatically re-queued to run again elsewhere, likely requiring no action from the user.
* In the HPC Cluster, such jobs may need to be re-queued. 

Please review your jobs and email us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu if you’re not sure how to cleanly re-run work that may have been affected. We’ll be happy to help.

Best,

Your CHTC team

Greetings CHTC users, 

#### Support Email Responses are Back

We were able to make a quick fix to our support email address (chtc@cs.wisc.edu), and are now able to respond to help requests as normal. As we’ve accumulated a backlog of requests over the morning, it may still be a few hours before we respond to emails sent in before noon today (April 26). If you sent an email to our help address and haven’t received a reply by tomorrow (April 27) at noon, please follow up at the chtc@cs.wisc.edu address again.

## HPC Cluster downtime on Tuesday, April 27
### Tuesday, April 20, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

_This message is for users of our high performance computing (HPC) cluster._

In order to incorporate new hardware, update network switches, and perform other general maintenance, **there will be an HPC Cluster downtime on Tuesday, April 27**, starting at 9:00am, and expected to last up to 6 hours. 

To prevent jobs from being interrupted by the downtime, we are currently draining jobs from all cluster nodes. **Submitted jobs requesting 7 days (or any time request that cannot be completed by April 27) will not start until the downtime is complete.** Jobs can still run on the cluster, but only if their time request (“--time=” in the submit file) indicates that they will complete before next Tuesday, April 27. 

We will send a reminder about the downtime on Monday, April 26, and a confirmation when the cluster is back up on April 27. Please contact us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions and concerns.
