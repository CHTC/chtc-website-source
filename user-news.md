## CHTC Website Content Now in GitHub
### Wednesday, January 08, 2020

Happy New Year!


**We'd like to announce that the [CHTC website](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) content (including online guides) are now [hosted publicly in a GitHub repository](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source).** Among other plans for improving the website over the coming year, we have made this change to make it easier for the extended CHTC community to contribute and suggest changes to page content.

**Therefore, we'd like to formally invite YOU to contribute to the CHTC website in the following ways:**

1. Especially, because we're still transitioning the source file format for each page (from raw .shtml to Markdown), **you can let us know if you see any formatting problems we haven't caught** by emailing [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu) (as always), or for GitHub enthusiasts, describe the problem as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source/issues) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source/pulls) with the correction.
2. **You can otherwise contribute typo fixes, content clarifications, and content suggestions via GitHub issues and pull requests!** (Or, continue to report any thoughts in email to [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu), at office hours, etc., per your preference.)

We look forward to getting more of your input for the CHTC website!  
Your CHTC Team
