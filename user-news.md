## Migrate from Gluster to new large-file staging system on HTC
### Wednesday, March 04, 2020

Greetings CHTC users,

This message is for users of our HTC System who use our Gluster file share to stage large files, e.g.
*   input files per job, greater than 100MB, each
*   output per job, greater than a few GB, total

We are transitioning from our Gluster file share for large data to a new system, with the goal of providing improved performance and stability.

**Important Dates**
*   March 4 (today) - Applications open for space on the new large-data system.  
*   April 1 - Jobs that require Gluster will no longer run.
*   April 15 - Gluster file share is removed and all files in Gluster are deleted.
    

**Actions to Take**

If you use Gluster on our HTC system, here are the actions you need to take:
*   **Remove all data from Gluster as soon as possible.** Data in Gluster will be deleted on April 15.
*   **When you need to run new jobs with large input or output files,** request a directory on the new large-data system by sending an email our support address ([chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu)) with the following information:
	*   How many jobs you typically have queued at once, and how many files of what sizes those jobs will require in the large-data system; therefore ...
	*   Total space needed and how many total files/folders that will include
*   Note that you can request a directory for large data at any time; if you're not currently running jobs, you can just email us when the need next arises.    
*   **Follow the online guide for the new large-data system**: [http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/file-avail-largedata](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/file-avail-largedata)

Our software modules on the HTC System (for licensed software or compilers/MPI) will also be transitioning off of Gluster (where they currently live) over the next few weeks; we will send an update about the replacement modules and updated documentation next week, so stay tuned if this applies to you.

As always, direct any questions to our support email: [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu).

All the best,  
Your CHTC team

## CHTC Website Content Now in GitHub
### Wednesday, January 08, 2020

Happy New Year!


**We'd like to announce that the [CHTC website](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) content (including online guides) are now [hosted publicly in a GitHub repository](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source).** Among other plans for improving the website over the coming year, we have made this change to make it easier for the extended CHTC community to contribute and suggest changes to page content.

**Therefore, we'd like to formally invite YOU to contribute to the CHTC website in the following ways:**

1. Especially, because we're still transitioning the source file format for each page (from raw .shtml to Markdown), **you can let us know if you see any formatting problems we haven't caught** by emailing [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu) (as always), or for GitHub enthusiasts, describe the problem as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source/issues) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source/pulls) with the correction.
2. **You can otherwise contribute typo fixes, content clarifications, and content suggestions via GitHub issues and pull requests!** (Or, continue to report any thoughts in email to [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu), at office hours, etc., per your preference.)

We look forward to getting more of your input for the CHTC website!  
Your CHTC Team
