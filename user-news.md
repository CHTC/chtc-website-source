## HPC Cluster issue this afternoon (Wed, June 2)
### Wednesday, June 2, 2021

Greetings CHTC Users,

*This message is for users of our high performance computing (HPC)
cluster.*

This afternoon, our HPC administrator noticed an issue involving the
filesystem on our HPC cluster.
**While this issue is ongoing, you may have trouble logging in to the
HPC login nodes or interacting with files from the login and execute
nodes.**
We do not yet know if running jobs are affected. We will update you as
we learn more.

Please contact us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions and concerns.

Best,

Your CHTC team

## OSG Virtual School 2021: Learn to harness large-scale computing for research
### Thursday, May 13, 2021

Greetings CHTC users,

As we have in previous years, we invite you to apply to this year's Open Science Grid Virtual School, which will be held online this year. Check out the short application form and let us know if you have any questions by emailing chtc@cs.wisc.edu or user-school@opensciencegrid.org.

Cheers,
Your CHTC team

We are seeking applicants for the OSG Virtual School 2021, which will take
place the weeks of August 2-6 and 9-13.  As the name indicates, the School
will be all virtual again this year.

https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-2021/

Participants will learn to use high throughput computing (HTC) to harness
vast amounts of computing power for research, applicable to nearly any
field of study.  In past Schools, we have helped people in physics,
chemistry, engineering, life sciences, earth sciences, agricultural and
animal sciences, economics, social sciences, medicine, and more.

Participation in the event is free, but a selective application process is
required.

Ideal candidates are graduate students doing research and staff (e.g.,
facilitators, admins) supporting research that involves or could involve
large-scale computing - work that cannot be done on one laptop or a handful
of computers.  Also, we accept some post-doctoral students, faculty,
research staff, and advanced undergraduates, so make a strong case for
yourself regardless of your current role!

IMPORTANT DATES

* Application Period (OPEN NOW): 7-28 May 2021
* OSG Virtual School: 2-13 August 2021

## Certain execute nodes shut down
### Wednesday, May 12, 2021

Greetings CHTC users,

There was a short chilled water interruption this morning, leading to the shut off of 5 HTC System execute nodes, and 20 HPC Cluster execute nodes.

We expect that the impacted servers will be back up within the next day, but jobs running on these will have been interrupted and may require action from users:

* In the HTC System, these jobs are automatically re-queued to run again elsewhere, likely requiring no action from the user.
* In the HPC Cluster, such jobs may need to be re-queued. 

Please review your jobs and email us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu if you’re not sure how to cleanly re-run work that may have been affected. We’ll be happy to help.

Best,

Your CHTC team
