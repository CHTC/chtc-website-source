## HPC Cluster is up; some execute nodes yet to come online
### Monday, June 28, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

*This message is for users of our high performance computing (HPC) cluster.*

The HPC Cluster is mostly back up. Users should now be able to log in, access files, and submit jobs while we finish brining back up some down execute nodes.

Jobs that were running on the cluster at the time of the power outage (Friday, June 25) were interrupted. All jobs that were in the queue at the time of the outage are still in the queue and will re-run unless removed by users.

Email us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions or concerns. 

Thank you, again,

Your CHTC Team

## Partial (new) HTC outage
### Monday, June 28, 2021

Greetings CHTC users,

*This message is in regards to CHTC’s HTC System. An update on the HPC Cluster (still down) will follow later today.*

Beginning early Saturday morning (shortly after midnight), a different outage occurred in one of CHTC’s server rooms with some of the HTC execute servers (where some HTC jobs run) late yesterday. Interrupted jobs will have been re-queued to run elsewhere, just as with last week’s outage, so users should not have to resubmit. We are otherwise in touch with a few users who depend on some specialized hardware in the same server room.

Thank you, again, for your patience as we work to recover all services from the recent outages. As usual, if you have questions or issues, please email chtc@cs.wisc.edu.

Regards,
Your CHTC Team

## Update on CHTC systems
### Friday, June 25, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

An update from this morning’s message: 

* **HTC system**: Functionality is restored for submit servers, though we are still rebooting execute servers (these will just be unavailable to run jobs until they’re up). Email us if you notice any problems accessing the HTC system. 
* **HPC Cluster**: We are still working on bringing up the cluster’s network functionality after some issues due to the duration of the outage. For this reason, we need to keep the cluster down over the weekend, including login nodes. We will send another update about the cluster on Monday.

Thank you for your patience during this unplanned outage, and continue to email chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions or issues.

Regards,

Your CHTC Team

## Campus power outages; multiple CHTC systems affected
### Friday, June 25, 2021

Greetings CHTC Users,

As some of you may already know, there were some significant power outages earlier this morning, across multiple buildings on campus. CHTC's HPC Cluster is down, as well as portions of the HTC System, and we have been working immediately this morning to restore functionality.

We will send additional updates as we have more details to share, and we appreciate your patience in the meantime.

Thank you,

Your CHTC Team

## HPC Cluster back up today (6/9)
### Wednesday, June 9, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

*This message is for users of our high performance computing (HPC) cluster.*

The HPC cluster is back up after completing maintenance to its file system. 

Users should now be able to log in to the HPC cluster login nodes. All previously submitted jobs are still in the queue and will re-run automatically. We recommend that users with jobs that were running at the start of the downtime examine their output files for potential issues caused by the interruption of jobs. 

Please email us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any follow up questions or additional concerns. 

Best,

Your CHTC team

## HPC Cluster unplanned downtime starting now, possibly through next week (6/11)
### Friday, June 4, 2021

Greetings CHTC users,

This is an urgent message for users of our HPC Cluster.

We apologize for the lack of detailed update until now. While we thought the HPC Cluster filesystem had been repaired to stability early yesterday afternoon and had some specific users doing some tests, we discovered at the end of yesterday (just before we would have sent a positive update) that the issues had returned. **It appears that the filesystem will need more extended maintenance work, which we are beginning ASAP and hope to complete by sometime next week.**

**As of now, we need to take the following steps to prevent further issues until the downtime has ended:**

- users will not be able to log into the HPC Cluster until the TBD completion of the downtime
- running jobs will be re-queued, and so will remain in the queue until users can log in again
- jobs queued but not yet running will also remain in the queue

Additional details:

- While we plan to complete the maintenance work next week, this timeline is subject to change and we'll notify users as soon as we can.
- At this time we expect that all user data in the filesystem (i.e. /home and /software locations) will be preserved. The issue appears to be with the filesystem’s metadata (which keeps track of which data is where in the filesystem).
- If you have imminently urgent work delayed by this downtime, please get in touch ASAP to discuss.

As always, please email us with any questions or issues via chtc@cs.wisc.edu

Thank you for your patience,

Your CHTC Team
