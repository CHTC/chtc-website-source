<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Like most programs, Matlab is not installed on CHTC's high throughput compute system.  
One way to run Matlab where it isn't installed is to compile Matlab <code>.m</code> 
files into a binary file and run the binary by using a set of files called the Matlab 
runtime.  In order to run Matlab in CHTC, it is therefore necessary to perform the 
following steps which will be detailed in the guide below (click on the links to go 
to the relevant section):

	<li><a href="#script">Edit the script that runs Matlab</a></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><a href="#submit">Write a submit file that uses the compiled code and script</a></li>

</ol>

<p>If your Matlab code depends on random number generation, using 
a function like <code>rand</code> or <code>randperm</code>, please see 
the section on <a href="#random">ensuring randomness</a> below.</p>

<h1>1. Preparing Your Matlab Program</h1>

<p>You can compile <code>.m</code> files into a Matlab binary 
yourself by requesting an interactive session on one of our build machines.  
The session is essentially a job without an executable; 
<b>you</b> are the one running the commands instead (in this case, to compile the code). 
</p>

<a name="compile"></a>
<h2>A. Start an Interactive Build Job</h2>

<p>Start by uploading all of the Matlab code files (usually <code>.m</code>, <i>not</i>, 
<code>.mat</code> files) that you need to run your code to the submit server. </p>

<blockquote>If you have many of Matlab code files 
(more than 1-5), it's a good idea to combine them into a <code>.tar.gz</code> file (like a zip 
file), so that you can simply transfer the single <code>.tar.gz</code> file for 
compiling the code. You can create a tar file by running this command: 
<code>tar -czf code.tar.gz <i>files and folders</i></code></blockquote>

<p>Create the following special submit file on the submit server, calling it 
something like <code>build.sub</code>. </p>

<pre class="sub">
# Matlab build file

universe = vanilla
log = interactive.log

# List all of your .m files, or a tar.gz file if you've combined them.
transfer_input_files = <i>script</i>.m, <i>functions</i>.tar.gz

+IsBuildJob = true
requirements = (OpSysMajorVer =?= 7) && ( IsBuildSlot == true )
request_cpus = 1
request_memory = 2GB
request_disk = 2GB

queue
</pre>

<p>Fill in the "transfer_input_files" line with <i>your</i> Matlab .m files, or a 
tar.gz file with all of the Matlab files your code uses. </p>

<p>Once this submit file is created, you will start the interactive job by 
running the following command: </p>
<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ condor_submit -i <i>build.sub</i>
</pre>

<p>It may take a few minutes for the build job to start.</p>

<a name="compile"></a>
<h2>B. Compile Matlab Code and Exit Interactive Job</h2>

<p>Once the interactive job has started, you can compile your code.  
In this example, <code>script.m</code> represents the 
name of the primary Matlab script; you should replace <code>script.m</code> 
with the name of your own primary script.  Note that if your main 
script references other <code>.m</code> files, as long as they are 
present in the working directory, they will all be compiled 
together with the main script into one binary.  
</p>

<blockquote>If you combined your Matlab <code>.m</code> files into one <code>.tar.gz</code>
file, make sure to "un-tar" that file before running the compiling steps below. </blockquote>

<p>To access the Matlab compiler on the build node, you'll need to load a the 
appropriate Matlab module. For Matlab 2015b, the module load command will look 
like this: 
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ module load MATLAB/R2015b</pre>
If you want to use Matlab 2018b, load module <code>MATLAB/R2018b</code>. 

Once the module is loaded, run the compilation command: 
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ mcc -m -R -singleCompThread -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm <i>script</i>.m</pre>
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Compilation Options</b></br>

<p>There are other options for the <code>mcc</code> Matlab compiler 
that might be necessary for specific 
compiling situations.  For example, if your main .m script uses a set of 
Matlab functions or .m files that are contained in a subdirectory (called, say, 
<code>functions</code>), then your compiling command will need to use the 
<code>-a</code> flag at the end of the command like so: 
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ mcc -m \
                -R -singleCompThread -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm \
                script.m -a functions/</pre>
</p>

<p>(The backslashes, \, are there just to break up the full command.)  </p>

<p>If you have questions about compiling your particular code, <a href="mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu">contact 
a facilitator</a> or see 
the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/mcc.html">Matlab documentation</a> for 
more information about using <code>mcc</code>.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exit the interactive session after you have compiled your code: 
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ exit</pre>
Condor will transfer your compiled code and its scripts back automatically.</p>

<p>Back on the submit node, you 
should now have the following files: 
<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ ls -l 

-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 581724 Feb 19 14:21 mccExcludedFiles.log
-rwxrw-r-- 1 user user  94858 Feb 19 14:21 script
-rwxrw-r-- 1 user user   1024 Feb 19 14:00 script.m
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user   3092 Feb 19 14:21 readme.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 581724 Feb 19 14:21 requiredMCRProducts.txt
-rwxrw-r-- 1 user user   1195 Feb 19 14:21 run_script.sh
</pre>
The file <code>script</code> is the compiled Matlab binary.  You will not 
need the <code>mccExcludedFiles.log</code>, <code>requiredMCRProducts.txt</code> 
or <code>readme.txt</code> to run your jobs.  
</p>

<a name="script"></a>
<h2>C. Modifying the Executable</h2>

<p>The <code>mcc</code> command should have created a script called 
<code>run_*.sh</code> (where * is the name of your Matlab script; our 
example uses the name <code>script</code>).  This <code>run_*.sh</code> 
script will be the executable for your Matlab jobs and already has 
almost all the necessary commands for running your Matlab code. </p>

<p>You'll need 
to add one line at the beginning of the <code>run_*.sh</code> script that unpacks 
the Matlab runtime.  We'll also add some extra options to ensure Matlab 
runs smoothly on any Linux system. </p>

<p>The commands that need to be added, and their location looks like this 
(<b>replace <code>r2015b.tar.gz</code> with the appropriate version 
of Matlab, if you used something different to compile</b>): 
</p>
<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh
# script for execution of deployed applications
#
# Sets up the MATLAB Runtime environment for the current $ARCH and executes 
# the specified command.

# Add these lines to run_script.sh
tar -xzf <i>r2015b</i>.tar.gz
mkdir cache
export MCR_CACHE_ROOT=$PWD/cache

# Rest of script follows</pre>


<a name="submit"></a>
<h1>2. Running Matlab Jobs</h1>

<p>This section shows the important elements of creating
a submit file for Matlab jobs.  The submit file for your job will be 
different than the one used 
to compile your code.  As a starting point for a submit file, 
see our "hello world" example: <a href="{{'/helloworld' | relative_url }}">http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/helloworld.shtml</a>.
In what follows, replace our example <code>script</code> and <code>run_script.sh</code> 
with the name of your binary and scripts.  </p>
<ol>
	<li>Use <code>run_script.sh</code> as the executable: <br>
		<pre class="sub">executable = run_script.sh</pre>
		</li>
    <li>In order for your Matlab code to run, you will need to use 
a Matlab runtime package.  This package is easily downloaded from CHTC's web proxy; the 
version <b>must</b> match the version you used to compile 
your code.  Options available on our proxy include: 
    <ul>
	<li><code>r2015b.tar.gz</code></li>
	<li><code>r2018b.tar.gz</code></li>

    </ul> 
To send the runtime package to your jobs, list a link to the appropriate version 
in your <code>transfer_input_files</code> line, as 
well as your compiled binary and any necessary input files:
		<pre class="sub">transfer_input_files = http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/<i>r2015b</i>.tar.gz,script,input_data</pre>
	</li>
	<li> Include the appropriate arguments for <code>run_script.sh</code> 
	(as described in <code>readme.txt</code>).  This will be the name of the Matlab runtime 
	directory and any arguments your Matlab code needs to run.  The name of the Matlab 
	directories for the different versions are as follows: 
	<table class="gtable">
	<tr><th>Matlab version</th> <th>Runtime directory name</th></tr>
	<tr><td><code>r2015b.tar.gz</code></td> <td><code>v90</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td><code>r2018b.tar.gz</code></td> <td><code>v95</code></td></tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	So to run a Matlab job using <code>r2015b</code> and no additional arguments, the 
	arguments line should read: <br>
		<pre class="sub">arguments = v90</pre>
	If you <i>are</i> passing additional arguments to the script, they can 
	go after the first "runtime" argument: 
			<pre class="sub">arguments = v90 $(Cluster) $(Process) </pre>
</li>
<li>As always, test a few jobs for disk space/memory usage in order to 
make sure your requests for a large batch are accurate!  Disk space and 
memory usage can be found in the log file after the job completes. 
<b>If you are using Matlab 2018b, request at least 
5.5GB of DISK</b> as the runtime is very large for this version of Matlab.  </li>
</ol>

<a name="random"></a>
<h1>Ensuring Randomness</h1>

<p>This section is only relevant for Matlab scripts that 
use Matlab's random number functions like <code>rand</code>.</p>

<p>Whenever Matlab is started for the first time on a new computer, 
the random number generator begins from the same state.  When you 
run multiple Matlab jobs, each job is using a copy of Matlab that 
is being used for the first time -- thus, every job will start with 
the same random number generator and produce identical results. </p>

<p>There are different ways to ensure that each job is using different 
randomly generated numbers. 
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/why-do-random-numbers-repeat-after-startup.html?refresh=true">This
Mathworks page</a> describes one way to "reset" the random number 
generator so that it produces different random values when Matlab 
runs for the first time.  Deliberately choosing your own different
random seed values for each job can be another way to ensure different 
results.</p>
