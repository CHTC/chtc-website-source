<p>In order to properly submit jobs using Gluster, please make sure 
to do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ONLY submit Gluster-dependent jobs from within your home 
	directory (<code>/home/username</code>), and NOT from within 
	<code>/mnt/gluster</code>. </li>
	<li>Do NOT list any <code>/mnt/gluster</code> files in any 
	the submit file lines, 
	including: <code>executable, log, output, error, transfer_input_files</code>. 
	Rather, your job's ENTIRE interaction with files in <code>/mnt/gluster</code> 
	needs to occur WITHIN your executable, when it runs. </li>
	<li>In order for jobs to run on CHTC servers that have access 
	to the <code>/mnt/gluster</code> location, require execute servers marked 
	with "HasGluster" using a "Requirements" line in the submit file. </li>
	<li>Even though your job will internally use files in Gluster 
	(that should NOT otherwise be transferred by HTCondor), it is 
	still important to have "<code>should_transfer_files = YES</code>" (the default) 
	in the submit file so that the job will run AT ALL, because the 
	"executable", "log", "output", and "error" files still need to use 
	HTCondor file transfer, as usual. </li>
	<li>Request an adequate amount of disk space with "<code>request_disk</code>", 
	which will only pertain to the maximum amount of data within the 
	job working directory on the execute node, and not to files that 
	only ever exist within <code>/mnt/gluster</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the below submit file, as an example, which would be submitted 
from within the user's home directory:</p>

<pre>### Example submit file for a single Gluster-dependent job
universe = vanilla
# Files for the below lines will all be somewhere within /home/username,
# and not within /mnt/gluster/username
log = myprogram.log
executable = /home/username/run_myprogram.sh
output = $(Cluster).out
error = $(Cluster).err
transfer_input_files = myprogram
# Require execute servers that have Gluster:
Requirements = (Target.HasGluster == true)
# The below line needs to be set to "YES"
should_transfer_files = YES
# Make sure to still include lines like "request_memory", "request_disk", "request_cpus", etc.
