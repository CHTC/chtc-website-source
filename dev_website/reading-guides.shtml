<h1>Organization</h1>

Our guides each cover a distinct topic.  Some are more of a "how-to", with a list 
of specific instructions; others include suggestions but not explicit instructions, 
and others simply contain general or reference information. 

<h1>Pre-formatted text</h1>

<p>There are different kinds of pre-formatted text in our guides.  </p>

<ul>
<li>This text box: 
<pre class="sub">universe = docker</pre>
Indicates information that should be placed into a submit file</li>

<li>This text box: 
<pre class="file">#!/bin/bash</pre>
Indicates any other file -- a text file, user code, or a script.</li>

<li>This text box: 
<pre class="term">[alice@submit]$ condor_q</pre>
Shows commands that should be entered in the command line or terminal interface 
that appears when you have logged into a submit server or head node.  Note that 
the first part of the text, up to the <code>$</code> is what is called the 
"prompt".  This isn't something that you type, but standard text that appears 
at the start of each line waiting for a new command.  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
We use blocks like this to indicate instructions that may be relevant to some
people, but not all, or to offer general advice.  
</blockquote>

<h1>Customization</h1>

<p>Certain commands or files in our guides can (and should!) be copied verbatim.  
However, most commands or files will need some changes, using information like 
your username, your file or script name, or your job's ID.  This information 
is noted in italicized text, like so: </p>

<pre class="term">[alice@submit]$ condor_q <i>JobId</i></pre>
