<p>Linux containers are a way to build a self-contained environment that includes 
software, libraries, and other tools.  CHTC 
currently supports running jobs inside 
<a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker</a> containers.  This guide 
describes how to build a Docker container image that you can use for running 
jobs in CHTC.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Docker container images can be created using a special file format 
called a "Dockerfile".  This file has keywords that allow you to: </p>

<ul>
<li>use a pre-existing container as a base</li>
<li>copy files into the container</li>
<li>run installation commands</li>
<li>set environment variables</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a Docker command, you can then "build" a container image from this file, 
test it locally, and push it to a central Docker location where HTCondor can then 
use it to run jobs.  Different versions of the container image can be labeled with 
different version "tags".  This 
guide has:

  <li><a href="#examples">Examples</a></li>
</ol>

<b>Note that all the steps below should be run on your own computer, not in CHTC. </b>

<h1>A. Step by Step Instructions</h1>

<h2>1. Install Docker and get a Docker Hub account</h2>

<p>Download, install, and start the <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community">
Docker Community Edition</a> for your operating system.  
It sometimes takes some 
time for Docker to start, especially the first time. </p>

<p>Later, you'll need to push your new image to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a>.  In preparation, 
create an account there. </p>

<h2>2. Create a Dockerfile</h2>

<p>It's easiest to create a Docker container image by using a Dockerfile. This 
is just a plain text file with keywords that add elements to your Docker 
container.  You can call the file whatever you want, but the convention is to 
use the name <code>Dockerfile</code>, with no file extension.  </p>

<p>There are many keywords that can be used in a Dockerfile (documented on 
the Docker website here: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">Dockerfile keywords</a>), but for 
most scientific software, the options listed below should be a good starting point.  

<br><b>A. Choose a "base" container image</b><br>

<p>Often you don't want to start building your container image from scratch; you'll 
want to choose a base container image to add things to.</p>

<p>You can find a base container image by searching 
DockerHub. If you're using a scripting language 
like Python, R or perl, you could start with the official image from these languages.  
If you're not sure what to start with, using a basic Ubuntu image is often a good 
place to start.</p>

<p>Container images often have tagged versions.  Besides choosing the image you want, 
make sure to choose a version by clicking on the "Tags" tab of the image.</p>

<p>Once you've decided on a base image and version, add it as the first line of your 
Dockerfile, like this: 
<pre class="file">FROM username/imagename:tag</pre>
</p>

<b>B. Copy files and install software</b><br>

<p>The next step is the most challenging.  We need to add commands to the 
Dockerfile to install the software.  There are a few standard 
ways to to do this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use a Linux package manager (usually <code>apt-get</code> or <code>yum</code>)</li>
<li>Use a software-specific package manager (like <code>pip</code>, or <code>conda</code>)</li>
<li>Use installation instructions (usually a progression of <code>configure</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>make install</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these options will be prefixed by the <code>RUN</code> keyword. You can 
join together linked commands with the <code>&&</code> symbol; to break lines, put 
a backslash <code>\</code> at the end of the line. </p>

<p>If you need to copy specific files (like source code) into the container, you can 
do so by placing the files in the same folder as the Dockerfile, and using the 
<code>COPY</code> keyword. </p>


<p>In the example below, we show all these options: From a base ubuntu image, 
we copy in the Python source code, update system libraries with Ubuntu 
installer "apt-get", install 
Python from source, and then use pip to install the Python package numpy.  Note that 
the Python source code (<code>Python-3.2.1.tgz</code>) has been downloaded to 
the directory with the Dockerfile in advance.  </p>
<pre class="file">
FROM ubuntu/ubuntu:tag

COPY Python-3.5.2.tgz /tmp

RUN apt-get update

RUN cd /tmp
	&& tar -xzf Python-3.2.1.tgz \
	&& cd Python-3.2.1 \
	&& ./configure \
	&& make \
	&& make install

RUN pip3 install numpy
</pre>

<b>C. Set the environment</b>

<p>If you're installing a program to a custom location (like a home directory), 
you may need to add that directory to the container's system PATH. 

<pre class="file">
ENV PATH="/home/software/bin:${PATH}"
</pre></p>

<h2>3. Build and Tag</h2>

<p>So far we haven't actually created the container -- we've just been 
listing instructions for the container in the Dockerfile.  
But we are now ready to build the container image!</p>

<p>First, decide on a name 
for the image, as well as a tag.  Tags are important for tracking which version 
of the image you've created (and are using).  A simple tag scheme would be to use 
numbers (e.g. v0, v1, etc.), but you can use any system that makes sense to you. </p>

<p>To build and tag your image, open a Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt
(Windows) and navigate to the folder 
that contains your Dockerfile: 
<pre class="term">$ cd <i>directory</i></pre>
(Replace "directory" with the path to the appropriate folder.)
</p>

<p>Then make sure Docker is running (there should be a small icon on either your 
top or bottom status bar) and run: 
<pre class="term">$ docker build -t <i>username</i>/<i>imagename</i>:<i>tag</i> -f <i>dockerfile</i> .</pre>
Replacing <code>username</code>, <code>imagename</code> and 
<code>tag</code> with the appropriate values.  
</p>

<p>If you get errors, try to determine what you may need to add or change 
to your Dockerfile and then run the build command again.</p>

<h2>4. Test Locally</h2>

<p>This page describes how to interact with your new Docker image on your 
own computer, before trying to run a job with it in CHTC: 
<ul><li><a href="/dev_website/docker-test.shtml">Exploring Docker Containers</a> </li></ul>
</p>

<h2>5. Push to DockerHub</h2>

<p>Once your container image has been successfully built and tested, you can 
push it to DockerHub so that it will be available to run jobs in CHTC.  To do 
this, run the following command: </p>

<pre class="term">$ docker push <i>username</i>/<i>imagename</i>:<i>tag</i></pre>

<p>The first time you push an image to DockerHub, you may need to run this 
command first: </p>

<pre class="term">$ docker login</pre>

<p>It should ask for your DockerHub username and password.</p>
