<p>CHTC staff are in the midst up upgrading the default operating 
system on our high throughput compute system from 
Scientific Linux 6 (SL6) to a newer and slightly different 
Linux version - CentOS 7.  We will update this page with more 
information as we pass major transition milestones.  </p>

<h1>1. Current Status</h1>

<p>We have started converting our computers to the new operating 
system, in a gradual process over the course of the next several months.  
As of March 24, about 5% of our HTC system is running CentOS 7, and we will 
increase it as YOU submit more jobs that fill up the CenOS 7 job slots!  </p>

<h1>2. Who Can Use CentOS 7?</h1>

<p>We are having only a 
few CHTC users "opt in" to using CentOS 7 while we are still in 
the initial phases of the transition.
If you have received an email from CHTC facilitators 
about running your jobs on CentOS 7, and are interested in trying 
out the newly converted computers, see the instructions in 
section 3. </p>

<blockquote><b>If you have not received 
an email from a CHTC facilitator about testing out CentOS 7, please 
continue to submit jobs as normal</b> - the instructions on this 
page do not yet apply to you. </blockquote>

<h1>C. Getting Started on CentOS7</h1>

<h2>A. Run a Test Job</h2>

<p>First, submit 1-5 jobs that are typical for your work, after adding 
the following line to your submit file:  </p>

<pre class="sub">requirements = (OpSysMajorVer == 7)</pre>

<p>If the test jobs complete successfully, you are ready to run on 
CentOS 7.  <b>If you see errors or failed jobs, please contact the 
CHTC facilitators</b> as we want to know what doesn't work. </p>

<h2>D. Running Real Jobs</h2>

<p>By default, jobs will still run only on Scientific Linux 6.  You must 
opt into using CentOS 7 by adding requirements to your submit file.  
Once you've run a test job and are ready to run on both operating 
systems (or just CentOS7), do the following:</p>

<b>To run jobs on both SL6 and CentOS 7</b>

<p>Add the following line to your submit file: </p>
<pre class="sub">requirements = (OpSysMajorVer == 6) || (OpSysMajorVer == 7)</pre>

<b>To run jobs on <i>only</i> CentOS 7</b>

<p>Add the following line to your submit file: </p>
<pre class="sub">requirements = (OpSysMajorVer == 7)</pre>
