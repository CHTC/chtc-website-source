<p>CHTC maintains a Gluster file share, which should only be used for
files or software that are too large for HTCondor file transfer or SQUID. 
The below guide discusses how to use CHTC's Gluster option for jobs that
use or produce very large files.  See the table below, or our 
<a href="{{'/file-availability' | relative_url }}">comprehensive file availability page</a>
to make sure Gluster is the right option for your jobs.  </p>

<h1>1. Staging files within Gluster:</h1>
<p> After obtaining a user directory within <code>/mnt/gluster</code> on a 
CHTC-administered submit server, copy relevant files directly 
into this user directory from your own computer:</p>

<p>Example <code>scp</code> command on your own Linux or Mac computer:</p>
<pre class="term">$ scp large.file username@submit-5.chtc.wisc.edu:/mnt/gluster/username/</pre>

<p>If using a Windows computer:</p>
<p>Using a file transfer application, like WinSCP, directly drag the large 
file from its location on your computer to a location within 
<code>/mnt/gluster/username/</code> on the submit server.</p>

<a name="submit"></a>
<h1>2. Submit File and Job Submission</h1>

<p>In order to properly submit jobs using Gluster, please make sure 
to do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ONLY submit Gluster-dependent jobs from within your home 
	directory (<code>/home/username</code>), and NOT from within 
	<code>/mnt/gluster</code>. </li>

	<li>Do NOT list any <code>/mnt/gluster</code> files in any 
	of the submit file lines, 
	including: <code>executable, log, output, error, transfer_input_files</code>. 
	Rather, your job's ENTIRE interaction with files in <code>/mnt/gluster</code> 
	needs to occur WITHIN your executable, when it runs. </li>

	<li>Request an adequate amount of disk space with "<code>request_disk</code>", 
	which will only pertain to the maximum amount of data within the 
	job working directory on the execute node, and not to files that 
	only ever exist within <code>/mnt/gluster</code>.</li>

	<li>Make sure to use a submit file "Requirements" line to make sure 
	your jobs only run on execute servers that have access to Gluster</li>
</ul>

<p>See the below submit file, as an example, which would be submitted 
from within the user's home directory:</p>

<pre class="sub">### Example submit file for a single Gluster-dependent job
# Files for the below lines MUST all be somewhere within /home/username,
# and not within /mnt/gluster/username

log = myprogram.log
executable = /home/username/run_myprogram.sh
output = $(Cluster).out
error = $(Cluster).err
transfer_input_files = myprogram

# IMPORTANT! Require execute servers that have Gluster:
Requirements = (Target.HasGluster == true)

# Make sure to still include lines like "request_memory", "request_disk", "request_cpus", etc.

<h1>2. Using Large Files Within a Job</h1>

<p>As stated in <a href="#submit">2</a> above, all interaction with 
files and software in <code>/mnt/gluster</code> 
should occur within your job's main executable, when it runs.  This 
section shows different sample bash scripts that handle large 
<a href="#files-input">input</a> and <a href="#files-output">output</a>, 
which would serve as the job's "executable" in the submit file.  </p>

<a name="files-input"></a>
<h2>A. Managing Large Input Files Within a Job's Executable</h2>

<p>There are two options for having steps within your 
executable manage large input files.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Copy files from Gluster into the working directory (best, if possible)</h3>

<p>The recommended method is to copy input or software into the working directory of the job, and use it from there, being careful to remove such files from the working directory before the completion of the job (so that they're not copied back to the submit server as perceived output).

An example executable script is below:

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash
#
# First, copy the large file from /mnt/gluster into the working directory:
cp /mnt/gluster/username/large_input.txt ./
#
# Command for myprogram, which will us the file from the working directory
./myprogram large_input.txt myoutput.txt
#
# Before the script exits, make sure to remove the large file from the working directory
rm large_input.txt
#
# END</pre>

<h3>Option 2: Refer to files and software DIRECTLY from their location in Gluster 
(only if needed)</h3>

<p>
If your data or software package is larger than ~50 GB, or your software will only work 
if it remains in the same location where it was first installed, you will instead have your 
jobs use these files or software from where they are located in <code>/mnt/gluster</code>. 
Otherwise, Option 1 should ALWAYS be used.
</br></br>
Essentially, your job executable should refer to Gluster-located files 
and software using the <i>absolute</i> path (e.g.
 <code>/mnt/gluster/username/large_input.txt</code>).</p>

<p>Example, if your job executable is a unix shell (bash) script:</p>

<pre class="file">#!/bin/bash
#
# script to run myprogram, 
# which reads in a large file directly from Gluster
./myprogram /mnt/gluster/username/large_input.txt myoutput.txt
#
# END</pre>

<a name="files-output"></a>
<h2>B. Managing Large Output Files Within a Job's Executable</h1>

<p>There are two options for having steps within your 
executable write files to Gluster, as well as a consideration 
for large standard output.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Write output files to the working directory, 
then move these to Gluster</h3>

<p>It can be detrimental to the Gluster filesystem (and cause your 
jobs to run more slowly) to write files directly to Gluster from 
within a job.  Instead, have your executable write the file 
to a location within the working directory, and then make sure to move 
this large file to Gluster (or copy to Gluster, and then remove from 
the working directory), so that it's not transferred back to the home 
directory, like all other "new" files in the working directory will be. </p>

<p>Example, if executable is a shell script:</p>
<pre class="file">#!/bin/bash
# 
# Command to save output to the working directory:
./myprogram myinput.txt large_output.txt
#
# Move large output to Gluster:
mv large_output.txt /mnt/gluster/username/large_output.txt
#
# END</pre>

<h3>Option 2: Write output files directly to Gluster</h3>

<p>Essentially, your executable to should refer to files it will produce 
using the ABSOLUTE PATH (e.g. <code>/mnt/gluster/username/large.file</code>)</p>

<p>Example, if executable is a shell script:</p>
<pre class="file">#!/bin/bash
#
# script to run myprogram, 
# which writes a large file directly to Gluster
#
./myprogram myinput.txt /mnt/gluster/username/large_output.txt
#
# END</pre>

<h3>ALSO consider: Large standard output ("screen output") produced 
within your executable</h3>

<p>In some instances, your software may produce very large standard 
output (what would typically be output to the command screen, if you 
ran the command for yourself, instead of having HTCondor do it). Because 
such standard output from your software will usually be captured by 
HTCondor in the submit file "output" file, this "output" file WILL 
still be transferred by HTCondor back to your home directory on the 
submit server, which may be very bad for you and others, if that captured 
standard output is very large.</p>

<p>In these cases, it is useful to redirect the standard output 
of commands in your executable to a file in the working directory, and then 
move it into Gluster at the end of the job.</p>

<p>Example, if "<code>myprogram</code>" produces very large standard output, and 
is run from a script (bash) executable:</p>

<pre class="file">#!/bin/bash
#
# script to run myprogram,
# 
# redirecting large standard output to a file in Gluster:
./myprogram myinput.txt myoutput.txt > large_std.out
# 
# move large files to Gluster so they're not copied to the submit server:
mv large_std.out /mnt/gluster/username/large_std.out
# END</pre>

<h1>4. Removing files from Gluster after jobs complete</h1>

<p>Similar to the procedures from transferring files into Gluster,
you can directly copy files out of Gluster using command-line <code>scp</code>
or file-transfer applications like WinSCP.</p>

<h1>5. Software in Gluster</h1>

While it is possible to install software into Gluster, we recommend it 
<b>only as a last resort</b>.  If you think you may need Gluster for your 
software, <a href="mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu">email a research computing 
facilitator</a> to ask for installation protocol.
