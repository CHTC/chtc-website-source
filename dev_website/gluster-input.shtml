<p>The below guide discusses how to use CHTC's Gluster option for jobs that 
use or produce very large files.</p>

<b>To best understand the below information, users 
should already be familiar with:</b><br>
<ol>
	<li>Using the command-line to: navigate directories, 
	create/edit/copy/move/delete files and directories, 
	and run intended programs (aka "executables").</li>

	<li>CHTC's guides for In-job File Handling and

</ol>

<h2>Knowing When/Why to Use Gluster</h2>
<p> Make sure to see our <a href="/file-avail-gluster.shtml">
File Availability guide</a>, for additional discussion 
of Gluster, as compared to other CHTC options.</p>


<a name="staging"></a>
<h1>1. Staging files within Gluster:</h1>
<p> After obtaining a user directory within <code>/mnt/gluster</code> on a 
CHTC-administered submit server, copy relevant files directly 
into this user directory from your own computer:</p>

<p>Example <code>scp</code> command on your own Linux or Mac computer:</p>
<pre>$ scp large.file username@submit-5.chtc.wisc.edu:/mnt/gluster/username/</pre>

<p>If using a Windows computer:</p>
<p>Using a file transfer application, like WinSCP, directly drag the large 
file from its location on your computer to a location within 
<code>/mnt/gluster/username/</code> on the submit server.</p>

<h1>2. Submission and Submit File Implications</h1>

<a name="input"></a>
<h1>3. Using files in Gluster from within a job</h1>

<p>As stated in <a href="#submit">#2</a>, all interaction with 
files in <code>/mnt/gluster</code> 
should occur within your designated "executable", when it runs. 
Therefore, there are two options for having steps within your 
executable read from Gluster-staged files.</p>

<a name="input-direct"></a>
<h2>A. Option 1: Read input files DIRECTLY from their location in Gluster 
(best option, if possible)</h2>

<p>Essentially, your executable to should refer to Gluster-located files 
using the ABSOLUTE PATH (e.g. <code>/mnt/gluster/username/large_input.txt</code>)</p>

<p>Example, if executable is a unix shell (bash) script:</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash
#
# script to run myprogram, 
# which was transferred from my home directory and reads in a large file from Gluster
./myprogram /mnt/gluster/username/large_input.txt myoutput.txt
# END</pre>

<a name="input-copy"></a>
<h2>B. Option 2: Copy files from Gluster into the working directory (only if needed)</h2>

<p>In rare instances, the software you're using may not be able to 
read files from an absolute path like <code>/mnt/gluster</code>, and may only 
be able to read files from within or relative to the job's working 
directory (on the execute server). Please feel free to write to us 
if you think your software cannot read files directly from 
<code>/mnt/gluster</code>. We're happy to help you know for sure. </p>

<p>In such cases, you can simply copy the large file into the 
working directory, have your executable use it from the working 
directory location, and then make sure to remove this large 
file from the working directory so that it's not transferred 
back to the home directory, like all other "new" files in 
the working directory will be.</p>

<p>Example, if "<code>myprogram</code>" cannot read files from <code>/mnt/gluster</code>:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash
# 
# First, copy the large file from /mnt/gluster into the working directory:
cp /mnt/gluster/username/large_input.txt ./
# Command for myprogram
./myprogram large_input.txt myoutput.txt
# Before the script exits, make sure to remove the large file from the working directory
rm large_input.txt
# END</pre>

<h1>4. Removing files from Gluster after jobs complete</h1>

<p>Similar to the procedures from transferring files into Gluster in 
<a href="staging">#1</a>, 
you can directly copy files out of Gluster using command-line <code>scp</code>
or file-transfer applications like WinSCP.</p>
