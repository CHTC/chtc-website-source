<!-- Submitting Many Jobs with a Single Submit File -->

<h1>Overview</h1>

One of HTCondor's features is the ability to submit many similar jobs using 
one submit file.  This is accomplished by using: 
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>a "queue" keyword, that indicates how many jobs to run</li>
  <li><i>variables</i> in the submit file, taking the place of information 
  that will change with each job, such as input files, input directories, or 
  code arguments.  Variables in an HTCondor submit file look like this: 
  <code>$(variable_name)</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are different ways to "queue" multiple jobs and indicate the difference 
between them using variables.  </p>

<ol>
<li><b><a href="#process">Using Integer-Numbered Input Information</a></b> - assumes that each job needs a different (numbered) input file</li>
<li><b><a href="#foreach">Using Any Unique Input Information</a></b> - assumes that each job needs a different input file</li>
  <li><b><a href="#multiple-args">Supplying Multiple Variables per Job</a></b> - assumes that multiple items (input files, arguments, directories) are changing for each job</li>
<li><b><a href="#initialdir">Organizing Jobs in Individual Directories</a></b> - another 
option that can be helpful in organizing job submissions.</li>
</ol>

<p>This guide merely scratches the surface of what is possible when submitting 
many jobs from a submit file.  If you are interested in a particular approach 
that isn't listed here, <a href="mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu">contact a Research 
Computing Facilitator</a> and we can advise on the best implementation.  Also, 
<a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2017/presentations/TueKoch_UserTut.pdf">this
presentation</a> from HTCondor Week contains some of the information contained

<h1>1. Submitting Multiple Jobs Using Integer-Numbered Input Files</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>This example is most similar to our
 <a href="http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/helloworld.shtml">Intro to Running HTCondor
 Jobs</a>.  </p>
 </blockquote>

<p>This method addresses an example where you have multiple, numbered 
input files and want to run a job for each one.  Suppose our directory on the 
submit server has these files as well as our program (<code>my_exec</code>): </p>

<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ ls 
0.data  1.data  2.data  my_exec  reference.data
</pre>

<p>The syntax to run the program is like this: 
<pre class="term">$ ./my_exec 0.data</pre>
</p>

<p>Suppose we want to run "my_exec" three times, once for each ".data" file, and 
where every job needs the "reference.data" file.  
We will use HTCondor's built in <code>$(Process)</code> variable 
 to create multiple numbered jobs, each using a different input file.  In a 
 submit file, this will look like this: </p>

<pre class="sub">
# Submit File
executable = my_exec
arguments = $(Process).data
transfer_input_files = $(Process).data, reference.data
output = $(Process).out

queue 3
</pre>

<p>Here the <code>queue 3</code> line will create 3 jobs.  Each job will be assigned 
a unique "Process" number, starting with 0 and ending with 2.  For each job, the 
appropriate number will replace <code>$(Process)</code> in the submit file above.  This 
means that each job will transfer a unique input file and also use that filename 
as the argument to the executable.</p>

<p>More generally, for "queue <i>N</i>" in the submit file,
 the $(Process) variable will start with
 "0" and end with <i>N</i>-1, such that you can use <code>$(Process)</code> to indicate
 unique filenames and filepaths. </p>

<p>Once the job(s) finishes running, the directory on the submit server should 
look like this: </p>

<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ ls
0.data  0.out  1.data  1.out  2.data  2.out  my_exec  reference.data
</pre>

</br>

<blockquote>
<h3>Starting at One</h3>

<p>What if your files are numbered 1 - 100 instead of 0 - 99?  Instead of renaming your 
files, you can do the following.  In your submit file, use: </p>
<pre class="sub">plusone = $(Process) + 1
NewProcess = $INT(plusone,%d)</pre>

<p>Then use <code>$(NewProcess)</code> anywhere in the submit file that you would have
normally used <code>$(Process)</code>.  </p>

<p>Note that there is nothing special about the names <code>plusone</code> and 
<code>NewProcess</code> - you can use any names you want as variables.  
</blockquote>

<a name="foreach"></a>
<h1>2. Submitting Multiple Jobs Using Unique Input Information</h1>

<p><a href="#process">The previous example</a> is great for numbered
files but it's not always convenient to use this 
naming scheme.  It is possible to write a single submit file that uses 
different non-numbered files or directories by using a different 
<code>queue</code> statement.  </p>

<p>Suppose we have a program called <code>compare_states</code> and we want to run it 
on data from three different states.  The full command 
for one state looks like this: 
<pre class="term">
$ ./compare_states -i missouri.data -o missouri.data.out
</pre>
</p>

<p>And we have the following different data files in our 
submit directory: </p>

<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ ls
compare_states  iowa.data  missouri.data  united-states.data  wisconsin.data
</pre>

<p>Here, we want to create a job for each state data file, 
and use the <code>united-states.data</code> file for 
all three jobs.</p>  

<p>First, we will make a list of each data file that we want 
to use in an individual job: </p>

<b><code>state_list.txt</code></b>
<pre class="file">
iowa.data
missouri.data
wisconsin.data
</pre>

<p>Then, in the submit file, we will use that list as part of the <code>queue</code>
statement.  We will choose a variable name for the items in the list; in this case, we've 
chosen the word "state".  </p>

<pre class="sub">
# Submit File
executable = compare_states
arguments = -i $(state) -o $(state).out
transfer_input_files = $(state),united-states.data

queue state from state_list.txt
</pre>

<p>That final "queue...from" statement will create a job for every file in our 
list.  It will assign each file to the "state" variable in turn.  In the rest 
of the submit file, <code>$(state)</code> will be replaced by the values in 
the list, one value for each job.  Here we've used the values from the list to 
transfer the appropriate input file and use the right arguments for the job.  When the 
job completes, the home directory would look like this: </p>

<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ ls
compare_states  iowa.data.out  missouri.data.out   wisconsin.data
iowa.data       missouri.data  united-states.data  wisconsin.data.out
</pre>

</br>

<blockquote>
<b>Tips for creating a list</b> </br> 
<p>If you want a quick way to create a list of 
files like "state_list.txt", use the shell command <code>ls</code> and the 
greater-than symbol <code>&gt;</code> to list your files and then save
them.  For example: 
<pre class="term">[alice@submit]$ ls *.data > my_files.txt</pre>
Will list all files that end with the ".data" extension and save them to a 
file called "my_files.txt".</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Naming Variables</b> </br> 

<p>You can use any names you like in the "queue ... from" statement: 
<pre class="sub">
queue year from list.txt
queue state from list.txt
queue x from list.txt
</pre>

We recommend using a descriptive name so that it is easier to read your submit file.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="list"></a>
<h2>Other Ways of Listing Files</h2>

<p>There are two other ways to provide a list to the submit file, 
where you would like each item 
in the list to create its own job. In the examples below, we are assuming the 
same program and files as above.  </p>

<a name="matching"></a>
<b>a. Create jobs "matching" a file pattern</b><br>

<p>This method of submission creates a job for each file or directory that 
matches the pattern provided in your submit file.  </p>

<pre class="sub">
# Submit File
executable = compare_states
transfer_input_files = $(state),united-states.data
out = $(state).out

queue state matching *.data
</pre>

<p>In this case, we have generated a list by using the pattern
<code>*.data</code>; a job will be created for each file that ends 
with the "data" suffix.  </p>

<a name="in"></a>
<b>b. Create jobs from a list written into the submit file</b></br> 

<p>In this final example, the list of desired items is written directly into the submit
file using the syntax "queue ... in ( ... )"</p>

<pre class="sub">
# Submit File
executable = compare_states
transfer_input_files = $(state),united-states.data
out = $(state).out

queue state in (iowa.data 
		missouri.data 
		wisconsin.data)
</pre>



<a name="multiple-args"></a>
<h1>3. Using Multiple Input Information</h1>

<p>The method of job submission shown above in a <a href="#foreach">queue ... from</a> 
statement can also be used to submit jobs using multiple values.  Suppose that 
we want to run two jobs for each state file - one for 2013 and one for 2015, using 
this syntax: </p>

<pre class="term">
$ compare_states -y 2015 -i wisconsin.data -o wisconsin_2015.out
</pre>

<p>We will 
create a list of each combination that we want to run: 
</p>

<b><code>states_list.txt</code></b>
<pre class="file">
2013, wisconsin
2015, wisconsin
2013, missouri
2015, missouri
2013, iowa
2015, iowa
</pre>

<p>Then, in the submit file, we use the same "queue ... from" syntax as before, 
but we include two variables (one for each value in the line) that we can use 
in the submit file.</p> 

<pre class="sub">
executable = compare_states
arguments = -y $(year) -i $(state).data -o $(state)_$(year).out
transfer_input_files = $(state).data, united-states.data

queue year,state from states_list.txt
</pre>

<p>This setup will create six jobs, one for each line in the 
<code>states_list.txt</code> file. </p>

<p>Note that in this example, we used just the filename prefix (the state name) 
as our changing value, not the entire filename (state.data).  Using just the 
file prefix allows us to be more flexible in the files we can reference.</p>

<a name="initialdir"></a>
<h1>4. Dividing Jobs Into Multiple Directories</h1>

<p>One way to organize jobs is to assign each job to its own directory, 
instead of putting files in the same directory with unique names.  To 
continue our "compare_states" example, suppose there's a directory for 
each state you want to analyze, and each of those directories has its 
own input file, like so: </p>

<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ ls -F
compare_states  iowa/  missouri/  united-states.data  wisconsin/

[alice@submit]$ ls -F wisconsin/
input.data

[alice@submit]$ ls -F missouri/
input.data

[alice@submit]$ ls -F iowa/
input.data
</pre>

<p>We will use two features to submit jobs.  First, like we have done 
for the previous examples, create a list of the items that are changing 
for each job.  In this case, it will be each directory. </p>

<b><code>states_list.txt</code></b>
<pre class="file">
iowa
missouri
wisconsin
</pre>

<p>There will be a "queue ... from" statement to create a job for each 
directory in the list.  However, we will add another item to the submit file 
called "initialdir" that will submit each job out of its own directory: </p>

<pre class="sub">
# Submit File
executable = compare_states
arguments = input.data output.data
initialdir = $(state)
transfer_input_files = input.data, ../united-states.data
out = job.out

queue state from states_list.txt
</pre>

<p>Here, HTCondor will create a job for each state in the list and use that 
state's directory as the "initialdir" - the directory where the job will actually 
be submitted.  Therefore, in <code>transfer_input_files</code>, we can use 
<code>input.data</code> without using the directory name in the path, and to use 
the <code>united-states.data</code> file, we need to indicate it is in the directory 
above the state directory.  The output file will also go into the state directory. </p>

<p>After the job runs, the job directories would look like this: </p>

<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ ls -F
compare_states  iowa/  missouri/  united-states.data  wisconsin/

[alice@submit]$ ls -F wisconsin/
input.data  output.data  job.out

[alice@submit]$ ls -F missouri/
input.data  output.data  job.out

[alice@submit]$ ls -F iowa/
input.data  output.data  job.out
</pre>
