It is important to manage your data well, in order to optimize your 
use of high throughput computing.  Our default method of delivering 
files and data to a job is <a href="/file-avail-transfer.shtml">HTCondor file 
transfer</a>, however, this method becomes inefficient for large files and 
it is important to use CHTC's other two methods (<a href="/file-avail-squid.shtml">
SQUID web proxy</a> and <a href="/file-avail-gluster.shtml">Gluster file share</a>)
when appropriate.  This table contains a summary of appropriate data 
management options, and there is a full description of each below the table.

<h1>HTCondor File Transfer</h1>

<p>HTCondor file transfer is the standard solution for file portability, and is 
built in to HTCondor job scheduling. You can see HTCondor file transfer as introduced 
in our "Intro to Running HTCondor Jobs" and in the 
<a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/2_5Submitting_Job.html#SECTION00354000000000000000">HTCondor Manual.</a></p>

<h2>Applicability</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Intended use:</dt> <dd>Good for delivering any type of data to jobs, but with file-size 
limitations (see below). Remember that you can/should split up a large input file 
into many smaller files for cases where each job only needs a portion of the data. 
By default, the submit file "executable", "output", "error", and "log" files are ALWAYS 
transferred.</dd>
<dt>Advantages:</dt> <dd>HTCondor's file transfer is robust and is available on 
ANY of CHTC's accessible HTC resources (including the UW Grid of campus pools, and the 
Open Science Grid).</dd>
<dt>Input File Limitations:</dt> <dd>HTCondor's file transfer can cause issues 
for submit server performance when too many jobs are transferring too much data 
at the same time. Therefore, HTCondor file transfer is only good for input files 
up to ~20 MB per file IF the number of concurrently-queued jobs will be 100 or greater. 
Even when individual files are small, there are issues when the total amount of input 
data per-job approaches 500 MB. For cases beyond these limitations, one of our 
other CHTC file delivery methods should be used. Remember that creating a *.tar.gz 
file of directories and files can give your input and output data a useful amount 
of compression.</dd>
<dt>Output File Limitations:</dt> <dd>Because jobs are less likely to be completing at 
the same time, total job output size of up to 1 GB will not cause submit server 
performance issues, but it's always advantageous to create a *.tar.gz file of all 
desired output before job completion (and to also delete the un-tar'd files so 
they are not also transferred back).</dd>
<dt>Data Security:</dt> <dd>Files transferred with HTCondor transfer are owned by the 
job and protected by user permissions in the CHTC pool. When signaling your jobs to 
run on the UW Grid (Flocking) or the Open Science Grid (Glidein), your files will 
exist on someone else's computer only for the duration of each job. Please feel free 
to email us if you have data security concerns regarding HTCondor file transfer, as 
encryption options are available.</dd>

<h1>SQUID Web Proxy</h1>

<p>CHTC maintains a SQUID web proxy from which pre-staged input files 
and executables can be downloaded into jobs using CHTC's proxy HTTP address.</p>

<h2>Applicability</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Intended Use:</dt> <dd>The SQUID web proxy is best for cases where many jobs will use 
the same large file (or few files), including large software. It 
is not good for cases when each of many jobs needs a <i>different</i> large input file, 
in which case <a href="/file-avail-gluster">"Gluster"</a> 
should be used. Remember that you're always better off by pre-splitting a 
large input file into smaller job-specific files if each job only needs some of 
the large files's data. If each job needs a large set of many files, you should create a 
<code>.tar.gz</code> file containing all the files, and this file will still need to be less than 4 GB.</dd>
<dt>Access to SQUID:</dt> <dd>is granted upon request to <a 
href="chtc@cs.wisc.edu">chtc@cs.wisc.edu</a>.  A user on CHTC submit
 servers may will be granted a user directory within <code>/squid</code>, which is only
 accessible via the CHTC submit server. As for all CHTC
 file space, users should minimize the amount of data on the SQUID web proxy,
 and should clean files from the <code>/squid</code> location regularly. CHTC staff reserve
 the right to remove any file from <code>/squid</code> when needed to preserve availability
 and performance for all users.</dd>
<dt>Advantages:</dt> <dd>Files placed on the SQUID web proxy can be downloaded by 
jobs running anywhere, because the files are world-readable.</dd>
<dt><b>Limitations and Policies</b>:</dt> <dd><ul> <li>SQUID cannot be used for job output, as there is 
		no way to change files in SQUID from within a job. </li>
	<li>SQUID is also only capable of delivering individual files up to 
	4 GB in size. </li>
	<li>A change you make to a file within your <code>/squid</code> directory 
	may not take effect immediately on the SQUID web proxy if you use the same 
	filename. Therefore, it is important to use a <b>new filename</b> when 
	replacing a file in your <code>/squid</code> directory.</li>
	<li>Jobs should still ALWAYS and ONLY be submitted from within the 
	user's <code>/home</code> location.</li>	
	<li>Only the "http" address should be listed in the 
	"<code>transfer_input_files</code>" line of the submit file. File locations 
	starting with "<code>/squid</code>" should NEVER be listed in the submit file.</li> </ul>
	</dd>
<dt>Data Security:</dt> <dd>Files placed in SQUID can only be edited by the owner 
of the user directory within <code>/squid</code>, but will end up being world-readable on the 
SQUID web proxy in order to be readily downloadable by jobs (with the proper 
HTTP address); thus, large files that should be "private" should not be placed 
in your user directory in <code>/squid</code>, and should instead use CHTC's <a 
href="file-avail-gluster">Gluster</a> location for large-file staging.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Gluster File Share</h1>

<p>CHTC maintains a Gluster file share, which should only be used for
files or software that are too large for HTCondor file transfer or SQUID. </p>

<h2>Applicability</h2>

<dl>
        <dt>Intended Use:</dt> <dd>Gluster is a staging area for input files,
        output files, and software that are too large for file transfer or SQUID. 
	Files and software within Gluster will be available
        to jobs running in the CHTC Pool, only.</dd>
        <dt>Access to Gluster:</dt> <dd>is granted upon request to <a 
        href="chtc@cs.wisc.edu">chtc@cs.wisc.edu</a>. As for all CHTC
        file space, users should minimize the amount of data in their own
        directory within /mnt/gluster, and should clean files from 
        /mnt/gluster location regularly.</dd>
        <dt>Limitations: </dt> <dd><ul>
                <li><b>Access outside of CHTC?</b>Jobs relying on Gluster will only run in CHTC's HTCondor Pool,
		and data in Gluster is not accessible to HTCondor jobs running outside
		of this pool. It is always better to split large
		input files if only some of the input data is needed by each job,
		in order to avoid depending on Gluster.</li>
		<li><b>Not all files ... </b>Gluster should ONLY be used for files and software
		that cannot leverage another data accessibility mode. Files placed in /mnt/gluster 
		should NOT be listed in the submit 
		file (for example, as the "executable", "output", "error", or "log" 
		files, or for files listed in "transfer_input_files").</li>
                <li><b>Capacity</b>Each user is allowed a certain amount of space in Gluster,
                though we can increase this space for special requests to
                <a href="chtc@cs.wisc.edu">chtc@cs.wisc.edu</a></li>
        </ul></dd>
        <dt>Data Security:</dt> <dd>Files placed in Gluster are owned by the
        user, and only the user's own jobs can access these files (unless the
        user specifically modifies unix file permissions to make certain files
        available for other users).</dd>
