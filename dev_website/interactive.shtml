<p>This guide shows how to run an interactive job in CHTC</p>

<h2> Interactive Jobs </h2>

<p>One of the most useful tools for testing is HTCondor's interactive 
job feature.  An interactive job is essentially a job without an executable; 
you are the one running the commands instead, through a bash shell session.  </p>

<p>To request an interactive job:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Create a submit file as if you were submitting the job normally, with one change.  
   Don't include an executable line; instead, list your executable file in the <code>
   transfer_input_files</code> line.  
<pre class="sub"># sample submit file
universe = vanilla
log = interactive.log

should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
transfer_input_files = data_file,myprogram

request_cpus = 1
request_memory = 1GB
request_disk = 1GB
      
queue
</pre>
      </li>
   <li>Then, submit the job using the <code>-i</code> option: 
       <pre class="term">[alice@submit]$ condor_submit -i submit_file</pre>
       You should see a message like: 
       <pre class="term">Submitting job(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster 4347054.
Waiting for job to start... </pre>
       </li>
   <li>After a few minutes, the job should match and open an interactive 
   session on an execute server, with all the files you 
   listed in <code>transfer_input_files</code>  
   <pre class="term">Welcome to!
[alice@e000 dir0]$ </pre></li>
   
   
   <li>You are now on an execute 
   server, much like one your jobs will be running on when you 
   submit them to HTCondor.  Here, you can try running your executable.  
   		</li>
   <li>Once you are done, you can type <code>exit</code> to leave the 
   interactive session.  <b>Note that any files you created during the 
   session will be transferred back with you!</b>  Another useful tool 
   can be to save your history to a file, using the following command: 
     <pre class="term">$ history > history.txt </pre>
    	</li>
</ol>
