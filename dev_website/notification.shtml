HTCondor has an option that will send you an email when your jobs 
complete.  However, if you are submitting multiple jobs from one 
submit file, it will send you an email for every single job, which 
most people don't want.  There is a work around to receive one email 
after a batch of jobs completes, that requires creating two 
extra files.  To do this, keep reading.  

<h2>Main Submit File</h2>

First, set up the submit file that will submit all of your jobs.  
In this example, I have called this file <code>main.sub</code>, but you can 
use whatever name you want - in what follows, replace <code>main.sub</code> 
with whatever name you've chosen.  

<h2>Notification Job</h2>

Next, we will create a special job, whose main purpose is to
send a notification email.  To do this, create a submit file 
exactly like the one below, replacing <code>username@wisc.edu</code>
with your own email.  

<pre>
# notification.sub

universe = local
executable = true
notification = Complete
notify_user = username@wisc.edu

queue 1
</pre>

When submitted, this job will run briefly on the submit server, 
then send an email.  

<h2>Create a DAG</h2>

We will now combine these two files, so that the notification job 
runs after your main batch of jobs has finished.  We will do this 
using HTCondor's workflow system, called DAGMan.  

Create a text file with the following lines: 
<pre>
JOB main main.sub
JOB notify notification.sub
PARENT main CHILD notify
</pre>

You will submit this DAG file instead of the two submit files.  To 
do this, enter: 

<pre>
$ condor_submit_dag dag_file
</pre>

Where <code>dag_file</code> is the name of the file you just created.
