<p>HTCondor file transfer is the standard solution for file portability, and is 
built in to HTCondor job scheduling. You can see HTCondor file transfer as introduced 
in our "Intro to Running HTCondor Jobs" and in the 
<a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/2_5Submitting_Job.html#SECTION00354000000000000000">HTCondor Manual.</a></p>

<h2>1. Transferring Input Files</h2>

<p>Simply add the "transfer_input_files" line to your submit file, like so:</p>
<pre class="sub">transfer_input_files = file1,../file2,/home/username/file3,dir1,dir2/</pre>

<p>Note: By default, the submit file "executable", "output", and "error" files are 
ALWAYS transferred.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>DO NOT use "transfer_input_files" for files within /squid or /mnt/gluster, 
	as doing so will create severe performance issues for your jobs and those of 
	other users. (Similarly, you should never submit jobs from within /squid 
	or /mnt/gluster.)</li>
	<li>Comma-separated files and directories to-be-transferred should be listed 
	with a path relative to the submit directory, or can be listed with the 
	absolute path(s), as shown above for "file3". The submit file "executable" 
	is automatically transferred and does not need to be listed in 
	"transfer_input_files".</li>
	<li>All files that are transferred to a job will appear within the top of 
	the working directory of the job, regardless of how they are arranged within 
	directories on the submit server.</li>
	<li>A whole directory and it's contents will be transferred when listed without 
	the "/" after the directory name. When a directory is listed with the "/" 
	after the directory name, only the directory contents will be transferred.</li>
	<li>Jobs will be placed on hold by HTCondor if any of the files or directories 
	do not exist (or if you have a typo).</li>
	<li>See more about <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/2_5Submitting_Job.html#SECTION00354000000000000000">
	file transfer in the HTCondor Manual.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Transferring Output Files</h2>

<p><b>HTCondor will automatically transfer back ALL new or modified files to the 
submit directory.</b> This automatically includes the "output" and "error" files 
indicated in the submit file.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Output files transferred back to the submit server will appear in the initial 
	submit directory of the job.</li>
	<li>HTCondor does not automatically transfer back new directories. Therefore, 
	it is a best practice to have your job(s) create a *.tar.gz file for desired 
	output directories, so that the *.tar.gz file gets transferred AND so that it 
	is compressed. </li>
	<li>It is important to have your job remove all unwanted "new" files before 
	job completion, so that these are NOT transferred back as perceived output. 
	This includes files that have arrived in the job working directory via an 
	alternate file delivery method.</li>
	<li>It is possible to list only your desired output files by using 
	"transfer_output_files" in the submit file; however, if you have a typo in a 
	filename or if any of the files are not created during the job, the job 
	will be placed on hold and ALL output lost (which can be a pain). Therefore, 
	"transfer_output_files" should be used with caution, or for jobs that always 
	first create these output files (perhaps empty), even if the job later exits 
	early with an error.</li>
</ul>
