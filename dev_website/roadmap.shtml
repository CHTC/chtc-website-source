<p>This guide assumes that you have gotten an account at CHTC 
on one of our compute systems. If you do *not* have an account at CHTC (or if you 
aren't sure), fill out the <a href="{{'/form' | relative_url }}">account request
form</a> or email CHTC's research computing facilitators at 
<a href="">chtc@cs.wisc.edu</a>.  </p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Once you have an account at CHTC, there are 4 common steps to getting started 
with running work.  The very first time you use CHTC resources, you should plan to go 
through all of the following steps; as you continue to use CHTC and do new kinds 
of work, you'll need to go through steps 3 - 4 with each new kind of job submission. </p>

<b>1. Log In and Move Files</b><br>

<p>As a pre-requisite to using any CHTC resources, you will need to be able to:
<ul>
<li>log in to a remote server</li>
<li>transfer files from a remote server to another 
computer that you can access</li>
<li>have basic command line skills for navigating 
directories (folders) and manipulating files.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>2. Practice Job Submission</b><br>

<p>Familiarize yourself with the practice of job submission by running 
one of our sample jobs.  </p>

<b>3. Prepare One Job</b><br>

<p>The next step to running work in CHTC is to get one (small) job ready to 
run by: 
<ul>
<li>downloading or installing your software</li>
<li>copying any necessary data or 
scripts to your home directory on the submit/head nodes</li>
<li>creating a job 
submission file for that job.</li>
</ul></p>

<b>4. Test and Scale</b><br>

<p>Once you've assembled most of the pieces you need for your job, the next 
step is to test what you've created as a single or small job, and then to scale upwards to 
submit a "full scale" job or batch of jobs. </p>

<b>5. Use Additional Features (optional)</b><br>

<p>There can be additional tools to improve your CHTC use, including building 
up a workflow, accessing resources outside CHTC, and more.  </p>

<p>For more details specific to the system you will be using, see the expanded guides below: </p>

<h1>Roadmap For Running Jobs on the HTC System</h1>

<h2>1. Accessing the HTC system</h2>

<ul>
<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/connecting' | relative_url }}">Connecting to CHTC</a>:
This guide has instructions on how 
to log in, move files to and from the submit server, and use other command 
line skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Practice HTCondor Job Submission</h2>

<ul>
<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/hello-world' | relative_url }}">Hello World</a>: Run a simple HTCondor job.</li>
<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/condor_q' | relative_url }}">condor_q</a>: Learn about some of the different
options for <code>condor_q</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Preparing a Single Job</h2>

<b>A. Choose a Job Size</b></br>

<p>The ideal CHTC job is between 10 minutes and 1 day in length.  While jobs 
can run shorter and longer (up to 3 days), you'll generally maximize throughput
(fastest time to completion of all jobs together) 
by lowering job length.  If you can control how long your job is by breaking 
a larger task into pieces, or batching together many very short tasks, try 
to aim for jobs that are a few hours.  </p>

<p>Whether or not you can control job size, you should think through what 
one job is going to do, and what the input and output will be.</p>

<b>B. Prepare Your Software</b></br>

<p>Some programs are released as Linux binaries, which can be downloaded and 
run as is. </p>

<p>If your program has to be compiled from source code, follow the instructions
in our <a href="{{'/inter-submit' | relative_url }}">Build Job guide</a> to start an interactive
session for compiling. </p>

<p>For specific scripting 
languages or programs or using Docker containers, we have the following guides:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/python-jobs' | relative_url }}">Running Python Jobs</a>: Run Python code or scripts in CHTC</li>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/r-jobs' | relative_url }}">Running R Jobs</a>: Run R code or scripts in CHTC </li>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/matlab-jobs' | relative_url }}">Running Matlab Jobs</a>: Run Matlab code or scripts in CHTC </li>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/docker-jobs' | relative_url }}">Using Docker to Run Jobs</a>: Use Docker containers to run software in CHTC</li>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/mpi-jobs' | relative_url }}">Running Jobs that use MPI</a>: Information about the HTC system's MPI capabilities</li>
</ul>

<b>C. Prepare Your Data</b></br>

<p>Look at our <a href="{{'/file-availability' | relative_url }}">File Availability page</a> to determine
what method is best to handle your data.  If you need access to 
Squid or Gluster, email the CHTC facilitators.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/file-availability' | relative_url }}">Using Default File Transfer</a>: HTCondor's default method of handling files</li>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/file-avail-squid' | relative_url }}">Using Squid</a>: Web server for repeated, medium-sized downloads</li>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/file-avail-gluster' | relative_url }}">Using Gluster</a>: File share for large files</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Testing and Scaling Up</h2>

<ul>
<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/testing' | relative_url }}">Testing Job Submissions and Scaling Up</a>: Test
and responsibly scale up to many jobs</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Why test?</b> Spending the time and effort to run test jobs will pay off in more 
effective high-throughput computing in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
   <li> <b>Better matching:</b> Pinpointing the required amount of memory/disk space 
   will allow your jobs to match to as many computers as possible.  
   Requesting excessive amounts of memory and disk space will 
   limit the number of slots where your jobs can run, as 
   well as using unnecessary space that could be available for other users.  
   That said...</li>
   <li> <b>Fewer holds or evictions:</b> If you don't request *enough* memory or 
   disk and your job exceeds its request, it can go on hold.  Jobs that have 
   not been tested and run over 72 hours are liable to be evicted without 
   finishing.  </li>
   <li> <b>Fewer wasted compute hours:</b> the evictions and holds described 
   above will be wasted compute hours, decreasing your priority in the 
   high-throughput system while not returning any results.  </li>
   <li> <b>Making good choices:</b> knowing how big and how long your jobs are, 
   and the size of input/output files will show you how to most 
   effectively use CHTC resources.  Jobs under 2 hrs or so?  
   Allow your jobs to flock and glide to the UW Grid and Open Science Grid.  
   Input files of more than 5 GB?  You should probably be using the CHTC 
   large file staging area.  Longer jobs?  Include a line in your submit 
   file restricting your jobs to the CHTC servers that guarantee 72 hours.  </li>
	<li><b>Being a good citizen</b>:CHTC's high-throughput system has 
	hundreds to thousands of users, 
	meaning that poor computing practices by one user can impact many other users.  
	Users who submit jobs that don't finish or are evicted because of incorrect 
	memory requests are using hours that could have been used by other people.  
	In the worst case, untested code can cause other jobs running on an execute 
	server to be evicted, directly harming someone else's research process.  
	The best practices listed in these guides exist for a reason.  Testing your 
	code and job submissions to make sure they abide by CHTC recommendations 
	will not only benefit your own throughput but make sure that everyone else 
	is also getting a fair share of the resource.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Use Additional Features</h2>

<h1>Roadmap For Running Jobs on the HPC Cluster</h1>

<h2>1. Accessing the HPC cluster</h2>

<ul>
<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/connecting' | relative_url }}">Connecting to CHTC</a>:
This guide has instructions on how 
to log in, move files to and from the head nodes, and use other command 
line skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Practice SLURM Job Submission</h2>

<p>At the moment, we do not have a guide with a sample job that runs "out-of-the-box".  
However, the sample submit file in <a href="/HPCuseguide.shtml#batch-job">section 3B</a> of the 
<a href="{{'/HPCuseguide' | relative_url }}">HPC Use Guide</a> can be modified to run a short, simple command like
<code>sleep</code> for those who want to practice using SLURM commands.</p>

<h2>3. Preparing a Single Job</h2>

<b>A. Prepare Your Software</b></br>

<ul>
	<li class="spaced"><a href="{{'/file-availability' | relative_url }}">Using the HPC cluster's default MPI modules</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever possible, installation and basic testing should be 
performed in an interactive job, as described in <a href="/HPCuseguide.shtml#interactve-job">section 3A</a> of the 
<a href="{{'/HPCuseguide' | relative_url }}">HPC Use Guide</a> </p>

<b>B. Create a Submit File</b></br>

<p>Create a SLURM submit file that requests the resources necessary to your 
job and runs your commands.  Make sure that you review the table of 
partitions and associated nodes (found in <a href="{{ '/HPCuseguide.shtml#job-scheduling' | relative_url }}">section D</a> of the
<a href="{{'/HPCuseguide' | relative_url }}">HPC Use Guide</a>) to make sure that you know which
partition you want to use and that your resource request matches what is available 
in that partition.</p>

<h2>4. Testing and Scaling Up</h2>

<p>To test work in the HPC cluster, first run a small scale version of 
your work on 1-2 nodes.  If this completes successfully, slowly scale upward by 
adding nodes and/or increasing the complexity of your problem.  We recommend doing 
this gradually so that it becomes clear at what point extra nodes/cores will not 
help your program run faster.  

<p><b>Why test?</b> Spending the time and effort to run test jobs will pay off in more 
effective high performance computing in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Making the most of your time</b>: Jobs can run faster on multiple 
   nodes...but they may also take longer to start.  Testing your jobs can help 
   you weigh the trade-off between wait-time and execution-time for your particular 
   software and computation.</li>
	<li><b>Being a good citizen</b>:CHTC's cluster has hundreds of users, 
	meaning that poor computing practices by one user can impact many other people.  
	Not saving output before a job exits, requesting nodes that 
	aren't used by your program (or don't provide any speed up), or running code 
	that consistently fails or crashes 
	all waste resources that could have been used by others.  
	Testing your 
	code and job submissions to make sure they abide by CHTC recommendations 
	will not only benefit your own computing but make sure that everyone else 
	is also getting a fair share of the resource. </li>
</ul>
