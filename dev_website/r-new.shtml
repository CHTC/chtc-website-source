<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>CHTC provides several copies of R that can be used to run R 
code in jobs. See our list of supported versions here: <a href="#supported">CHTC Supported R</a></p>

<h1>1. Adding R Packages</h1>

<p>If your code uses specific R packages (like <code>dplyr</code>, 
<code>rjags</code>,  etc) follow the directions 
below to download and prepare the packages you need for job submission.  <b>If your 
job does not require any extra R packages, skip to parts 2 and 3</b>.  </p>

<p>You are going to start an interactive job that runs on the HTC build servers
and that downloads a copy of R.  You will then install your packages to a 
folder and zip those files to return to the submit server.</p>

<blockquote>These instructions are primarily about adding packages to a fresh 
install of R; if you want to add packages to a pre-existing package folder, there 
will be notes below in boxes like this one. 
</blockquote>

<a name="version"></a>
<h2>A. Submit an Interactive Job</h2>

<p>Create the following special submit file on the submit server, calling it 
something like <code>build.sub</code>. </p>

<pre class="sub">
# R build file

universe = vanilla
log = interactive.log

# Choose a version of R from the table above
transfer_input_files = http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/chtc/R<i>###</i>.tar.gz

+IsBuildJob = true
requirements = (OpSysMajorVer =?= 7) && ( IsBuildSlot == true )
request_cpus = 1
request_memory = 2GB
request_disk = 2GB

queue
</pre>

<p>The only thing you should need to change in the above file is the name of 
the <code>R###.tar.gz</code> file - in the "transfer_input_files" line. We 
have four versions of R available to build from -- see the table above.</p>

<blockquote>If you want to add packages to a pre-existing package directory, add
the <code>tar.gz</code> file with the packages to the <code>transfer_input_files</code> line:
<pre class="sub">transfer_input_files = http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/chtc/R<i>###</i>.tar.gz, <i>packages.tar.gz</i></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Once this submit file is created, you will start the interactive job by 
running the following command: </p>
<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ condor_submit -i <i>build.sub</i>
</pre>

<p>It may take a few minutes for the build job to start.</p>

<h2>B. Install the Packages</h2>

<b>1. Set up R</b></br>

<p>Once the interactive build job starts, 
you should see the R installation that you specified inside the working 
directory: 
<pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice  78M Mar 26 12:24 R<i>###</i>.tar.gz
drwx------ 2 alice alice 4.0K Mar 26 12:24 tmp
drwx------ 3 alice alice 4.0K Mar 26 12:24 var
</pre>
</p> 

<p>We'll now unzip the copy of R and set the <code>PATH</code> 
variable to reference that version of R:
<pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ tar -xzf R<i>###</i>.tar.gz
[alice@build]$ export PATH=$PWD/R/bin:$PATH
</pre>

To make sure that your setup worked, try running: 
 <pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ R --version
</pre>

The output should match the version number that you want to be using!
</p>

<blockquote>
If you brought along your own package directory, un-tar it here and skip 
the directory creation step below. 
</blockquote>

<b>2. Install packages</b></br>

<p> First, create, a directory to put your packages into: 
<pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ mkdir <i>packages</i>
</pre>

<p> Then, tell R to use that directory for the packages you're going to install:  
<pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ export R_LIBS=$PWD/<i>packages</i>
</pre>

You can choose what name to use for this directory -- if you have different 
sets of packages that you use for different jobs, you could use a more 
descriptive name than "packages". 
</p>

<p>Then start the R console: 
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ R</pre>
</p>

<p>
In the R terminal, first, set the package installation location, and then install your 
packages using <code>install.packages</code>.
<pre class="term">
> install.packages("<i>package_name</i>")
</pre>
</p>

<p>The first time you will be prompted to choose a "CRAN mirror" - this is where 
R is downloading the package. Choose any <code>http</code> (not <code>https</code>!) option.</p>

<p>When you've installed all your packages, exit the R console: 
<pre class="term">
> quit()</pre>
</p>

<h2>C. Finish Up</h2>

<b>1. Create a <code>tar.gz</code> file of your packages</b></br>

<p>Right now, if we exit the interactive job, nothing will be transferred back 
because we haven't created any new <b>files</b> in the working directory, just 
<b>sub-directories</b>.  In order to transfer back our installation, we will 
need to compress it into a tarball file - not only will HTCondor then transfer 
back the file, it is generally easier to transfer 
a single, compressed tarball file than an uncompressed set of directories.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create your own tarball of your packages: 
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ tar -czf <i>packages</i>.tar.gz <i>packages/</i></pre>

Again, you can use a different name for the <code>tar.gz</code> file, if you want.</p>

<b>2. Finish the interactive build job</b></br>

<p>We now have our packages bundled and ready for CHTC!  
You can now exit the interactive job and the 
tar.gz file with your R packages will return to the submit server with you.  </p>
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ exit </pre>

<a name="script"></a>
<h1>2. Creating a Script</h1>

<p>In order to use CHTC's copy of R and the packages you have prepared 
in an HTCondor job, we will need to write a script that unpacks both R 
and the packages and then runs our R 
code.  We will use this script as as the <code>executable</code> of our HTCondor 
submit file.  </p>

<p>A sample script appears below.  After the first line, the lines starting 
with hash marks are comments . You should replace "my_script.R" with the name of
the script you would like to run.  

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

# untar your R installation. Make sure you are using the right version!
tar -xzf R<i>###</i>.tar.gz
# (optional) if you have a set of packages (created in Part 1), untar them also
tar -xzf <i>packages</i>.tar.gz

# make sure the script will use your R installation, 
# and the working directory as its home location
export PATH=$PWD/R/bin:$PATH
export RHOME=$PWD/R
export R_LIBS=$PWD/<i>packages</i>

# run your script
Rscript <i>my_script.R</i>
</pre>
</p>

<p>If you have additional commands you would like to be run within the job, you 
can add them to this base script.  Once your script does what you would like, give 
it executable permissions by running: 
<pre class="term">
[alice@submit] chmod +x run_R.sh
</pre>

<blockquote>
<h2>Arguments in R</h2>
<p>To pass arguments to an R script within a job, you'll need to use the following 
syntax in your main executable script, in place of the generic command above: 
<pre class="file">
Rscript <i>myscript.R</i> $1 $2
</pre>
Here, <code>$1</code> and <code>$2</code> are the first and second 
arguments passed to the bash script from the submit file (see below), 
which are then sent on to the R script.  For more (or fewer) arguments, 
simply add more (or fewer) arguments and numbers.</p>

<p>In addition, your R script will need to be able to accept arguments from the 
command line.  There is sample code for doing this on 
<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/passing-arguments-to-an-r-script-from-command-lines/">this 
r-bloggers.com page</a> and about a quarter of the way into this 
<a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/05-cmdline/">Software
Carpentry lesson</a> (look for <code>print-args-trailing.R</code>). 
</p>

<a name="submit"></a>
<h1>3. Submitting Jobs</h1>

<p>A sample submit file can be found in our <a href="{{'/helloworld' | relative_url }}">hello world
</a> example page.  You should make the following changes in order to run 
R jobs: </p>
<ul>
	<li> Your <code>executable</code> should be the script that you wrote 
<a href="#script">above</a>. <pre class="sub">executable = run_R.sh</pre></li>
	<li>Modify the CPU/memory request lines.  Test a few jobs for disk space/memory usage in 
order to make sure your requests for a large batch are accurate!  
Disk space and memory usage can be found in the log file after the job completes. </li>
	<li> Change <code>transfer_input_files</code> to include: 
	<pre class="sub">transfer_input_files = http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/chtc/R<i>###</i>.tar.gz, <i>packages</i>.tar.gz, <i>my_script.R</i></pre></li>
	<li>If your script takes arguments (see the box from the 
        previous section), include those in the arguments line: 
        <pre class="sub">arguments = value1 value2</pre></li>
	</ul>
<a name="squid"></a>
<blockquote>
<h3>How big is your package tarball?</h3>

<p>If your package tarball is larger than 100 MB, you should NOT transfer 
the tarball using <code>transfer_input_files</code>.  Instead, you should use 
CHTC's web proxy, <code>squid</code>.  In order to request space 
on <code>squid</code>, email the research computing facilitators at 
<a href="mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu">chtc@cs.wisc.edu</a>.
