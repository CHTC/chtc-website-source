<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>CHTC provides several copies of Python that can be used to run Python 
code in jobs. See our list of supported versions here: <a href="#supported">CHTC Supported Python</a></p>

<p>This guide details the steps needed to: 
<ol>
	<li><a href="#build">Create a portable copy of your Python packages</a></li>
	<li><a href="#script">Write a script that uses Python and your packages</a></li>
	<li><a href="#submit">Submit jobs</a></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>If you want to build your own copy of base Python or use the miniconda 
Python distribution see these pages:

<h1>1. Adding Python Packages</h1>

<p>If your code uses specific Python packages (like <code>numpy</code>, 
<code>matplotlib</code>, <code>sci-kit learn</code>, etc) follow the directions 
below to download and prepare the packages you need for job submission.  <b>If your 
job does not require any extra Python packages, skip to parts 2 and 3.</b> </p>

<p>You are going to start an interactive job that runs on the HTC build servers
and that downloads a copy of Python.  You will then install your packages to a 
folder and zip those files to return to the submit server.</p>

<blockquote>These instructions are primarily about adding packages to a fresh 
install of Python; if you want to add packages to a pre-existing package folder, there 
will be notes below in boxes like this one. 
</blockquote>

<a name="version"></a>
<h2>A. Submit an Interactive Job</h2>

<p>Create the following special submit file on the submit server, calling it 
something like <code>build.sub</code>. </p>

<pre class="sub">
# Python build file

universe = vanilla
log = interactive.log

# Choose a version of Python from the table above
transfer_input_files = http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/chtc/python<i>##</i>.tar.gz

+IsBuildJob = true
requirements = (OpSysMajorVer =?= 7) && ( IsBuildSlot == true )
request_cpus = 1
request_memory = 2GB
request_disk = 2GB

queue
</pre>

<p>The only thing you should need to change in the above file is the name of 
the <code>python##.tar.gz</code> file - in the "transfer_input_files" line. We 
have two versions of Python available to build from -- see the table above.</p>

<blockquote>If you want to add packages to a pre-existing package directory, add
the <code>tar.gz</code> file with the packages to the <code>transfer_input_files</code> line:
<pre class="sub">transfer_input_files = http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/chtc/python<i>##</i>.tar.gz, <i>packages.tar.gz</i></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Once this submit file is created, you will start the interactive job by 
running the following command: </p>
<pre class="term">
[alice@submit]$ condor_submit -i <i>build.sub</i>
</pre>

<p>It may take a few minutes for the build job to start.</p>

<h2>B. Install the Packages</h2>

<p>Once the interactive build job starts, 
you should see the Python that you specified inside the working 
directory: 
<pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ ls -lh
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice  78M Mar 26 12:24 python<i>##</i>.tar.gz
drwx------ 2 alice alice 4.0K Mar 26 12:24 tmp
drwx------ 3 alice alice 4.0K Mar 26 12:24 var
</pre>
</p> 

<p>We'll now unzip the copy of Python and set the <code>PATH</code> 
variable to reference that version of Python:
<pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ tar -xzf python<i>##</i>.tar.gz
[alice@build]$ export PATH=$PWD/python/bin:$PATH
</pre></p>

<p>To make sure that your setup worked, try running: 
 <pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ python3 --version
</pre></p>

<p>You can also try running this command to make sure the copy of python 
that is now active is the one you just installed: 
<pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ which python3
</pre></p>

<p>The command above should return a path that includes the prefix 
<code>/var/lib/condor/</code>, indicating that it is installed in your 
job's working directory.  
</p>

<p>If you're using Python 2, use <code>python2</code> instead of 
<code>python3</code> above (and in what follows). 
The output should match the version number that you want to be using!
</p>

<blockquote>
If you brought along your own package directory, un-tar it here and skip 
the directory creation step below. 
</blockquote>

<p> First, create, a directory to put your packages into: 
<pre class="term">
[alice@build]$ mkdir <i>packages</i>
</pre>

You can choose what name to use for this directory -- if you have different 
sets of packages that you use for different jobs, you could use a more 
descriptive name than "packages"
</p>

<p>To install the Python packages run the following command: 
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ python3 -m pip install --target=$PWD/<i>packages</i> <i>package1</i> <i>package2</i> <i>etc.</i></pre>
Replace <i>package1</i> <i>package2</i> with the names of packages you want to 
install. <code>pip</code> should download all dependent packages and install them.  Certain
   packages may take longer than others. </p>

<h2>C. Finish Up</h2>

<p>Right now, if we exit the interactive job, nothing will be transferred back 
because we haven't created any new <b>files</b> in the working directory, just 
<b>sub-directories</b>.  In order to transfer back our installation, we will 
need to compress it into a tarball file - not only will HTCondor then transfer 
back the file, it is generally easier to transfer 
a single, compressed tarball file than an uncompressed set of directories.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create your own tarball of your packages: 
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ tar -czf <i>packages</i>.tar.gz <i>packages/</i></pre>

Again, you can use a different name for the <code>tar.gz</code> file, if you want.</p>

<p>We now have our packages bundled and ready for CHTC!  
You can now exit the interactive job and the 
tar.gz file with your Python packages will return to the submit server with you (this 
sometimes takes a few extra seconds after exiting).</p>
<pre class="term">[alice@build]$ exit </pre>

<a name="script"></a>
<h1>2. Creating a Script</h1>

<p>In order to use CHTC's copy of Python and the packages you have prepared 
in an HTCondor job, we will need to write a script that unpacks both Python 
and the packages and then runs our Python 
code.  We will use this script as as the <code>executable</code> of our HTCondor 
submit file. </p>

<p>A sample script appears below.  After the first line, the lines starting 
with hash marks are comments . You should replace "my_script.py" with the name of
the script you would like to run, and modify the Python version numbers to be the 
same as what you used above to install your packages.</p>

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

# untar your Python installation. Make sure you are using the right version!
tar -xzf python<i>##</i>.tar.gz
# (optional) if you have a set of packages (created in Part 1), untar them also
tar -xzf <i>packages</i>.tar.gz

# make sure the script will use your Python installation, 
# and the working directory as its home location
export PATH=$PWD/python/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/<i>packages</i>

# run your script
python3 <i>my_script.py</i>
</pre>
</p>

<p>If you have additional commands you would like to be run within the job, you 
can add them to this base script.  Once your script does what you would like, give 
it executable permissions by running: 
<pre class="term">
[alice@submit] chmod +x run_python.sh
</pre>
</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Arguments in Python</h2>
<p>To pass arguments to an R script within a job, you'll need to use the following 
syntax in your main executable script, in place of the generic command above: 
<pre class="file">
python3 <i>my_script.py</i> $1 $2
</pre>
Here, <code>$1</code> and <code>$2</code> are the first and second 
arguments passed to the bash script from the submit file (see below), 
which are then sent on to the Python script.  For more (or fewer) arguments, 
simply add more (or fewer) arguments and numbers.</p>

<p>In addition, your Python script will need to be able to accept arguments from the 
command line.  There is an explanation of how to do this in 
<a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/10-cmdline/index.html">this
Software Carpentry lesson</a>. 
</p>

</p>

<a name="submit"></a>
<h1>3. Submitting Jobs</h1>

<p>A sample submit file can be found in our <a href="/helloworld.shtml">hello world
</a> example page.  You should make the following changes in order to run 
Python jobs: </p>
<ul>
	<li> Your <code>executable</code> should be the script that you wrote 
<a href="#script">above</a>. <pre class="sub">executable = run_py.sh</a></li>
	<li>Modify the CPU/memory request lines.  Test a few jobs for disk space/memory usage in 
order to make sure your requests for a large batch are accurate!  
Disk space and memory usage can be found in the log file after the job completes. </li>
	<li> Change <code>transfer_input_files</code> to include: 
	<pre class="sub">transfer_input_files = http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/chtc/python<i>##</i>.tar.gz, <i>packages</i>.tar.gz, <i>my_script.py</i></pre></li>
		<li>If your script takes arguments (see the box from the 
        previous section), include those in the arguments line: 
        <pre class="sub">arguments = value1 value2</pre></li>
	</ul>
	</ul>
<a name="squid"></a>
<blockquote>
<h3>How big is your package tarball?</h3>

<p>If your package tarball is larger than 100 MB, you should NOT transfer 
the tarball using <code>transfer_input_files</code>.  Instead, you should use 
CHTC's web proxy, <code>squid</code>.  In order to request space 
on <code>squid</code>, email the research computing facilitators at 
<a href="mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu">chtc@cs.wisc.edu</a>.
