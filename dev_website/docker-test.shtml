title: Testing a Docker Container on Your Computer
---

<p>Linux containers are a way to build a self-contained environment that includes 
software, libraries, and other tools.  This 
guide shows how to submit jobs that use Docker containers.  </p>

<p>Assuming you already have a container that you want to run 
or investigate on your own computer.  </p>

<p><b>Note that all the steps below should be run on your 
own computer, not in CHTC.</b></p>

<p>If you created your own container image on your computer, you can skip 
steps A and B and start with C. </p>

<h2>A. Install Docker to your computer</h2>

<p>Download, install, and start the <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community">
Docker Community Edition</a> for your operating system.  It sometimes takes some 
time for Docker to start, especially the first time. </p>

<h2>B. "Pull" the container image that you're using</h2>

<p>We need to have a local copy of the Docker container image in order to 
test it.  To do this, choose which image you want to use and the tag for 
the version you want.  The syntax for the full container image name will be 
<code>username/imagename:tag</code>.  Then 
pull a copy of this Docker container image to your computer by running the following 
from either a Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows): </p>
		<pre class="term">$ docker pull <i>username/image:tag</i></pre></li>

<h2>C. Choose your executable</h2>

<p>There are two ways to run software inside a Docker container: </p>
<ol>
<li>Use a script that you transfer into the container, using software
installed in the container.</li>
<li>Use a script or executable program already inside the container.</li>
</ol>

<p>Instructions for each of these use cases is below.</p>

<h3>1. Using your own script (recommended)</h3>

<p>Write a script that runs the steps of your job.  
Unlike in many of our guides, this
script doesn't need to be written in a language
like bash; instead, it can use something like Python or R directly
from inside the container.  </p>

<p>Note, that it is important that <b>any</b> script that is run this way
will need a header at the top, indicating what kind of script it is.  Some
common headers include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Bash: <pre class="file">#!/bin/bash</pre></li>
<li>Python: <pre class="file">#!/usr/bin/env python</pre></li>
<li>R: <pre class="file">#!/usr/bin/env Rscript</pre></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<b>Do I need an executable script?</b> If your job only needs to run 
one command you don't need a script to serve as the jobs executable.  See 
below.  
</blockquote>

<h3>2. Using an executable already inside the container</h3>

<p>If the executable is already in the container, you simply 
need to know what command you need to run to use it.</p>

<h2>D. Create a folder with job files</h2>

<p>For testing, we need a folder on your computer to stand in for the directory that 
HTCondor creates for running your job.  Create a folder for this purpose 
on your Desktop.  The folder's name shouldn't include any spaces.  Inside 
this folder, put all of the files that are normally inside the working 
directory for a single job -- data, scripts, etc.  If you're using your own 
executable script, this should be in the folder.  </p>

<p>Open a Windows Command Prompt or Mac/Linux Terminal to access that folder, 
using: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Mac/Linux: </br>
		<pre class="term">$ cd ~/Desktop/<i>folder</i></pre></li>
	<li>Windows: 
	<pre class="term">$ cd %HOMEPATH%\Desktop\<i>folder</i></pre></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Replace "folder" with the name of the folder you created.</p>

<h2>D. Start the Docker container</h2>

<p>We will start the desired Docker container  
in order to see if it works.  First make sure Docker is running.  Then 
run the command below to start the container.  The command 
can be run verbatim except for the <code>username</code>, 
<code>imagename</code> and <code>tag</code>; these should be whatever you used 
to pull or tag the container image.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mac/Linux: </br>
		<pre class="term">$ docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) --rm=true -it \
  -v $(pwd):/scratch -w /scratch \
  username/imagename:tag /bin/bash</pre> </li>
	<li>Windows: 
	<pre class="term">$ docker run --rm=true -it -v %CD%:/scratch -w /scratch username/imagename:tag /bin/bash</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>For Windows users, a window may pop up, asking for permission to share your 
main drive with Docker.  This is necessary for the files to be placed inside 
the container.</p>
  
<h2>E. Test the job</h2>

<p>Your command line prompt should have changed to a number (this represents the 
running container instance).  We can now see if the job would complete 
successfully!  If you have an executable script, you can run it like so: 
<pre class="term">bob@12335:/scratch$ ./exec.sh</pre>
If your "executable" is software already in the container, run the appropriate 
command to use it.  
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following commands may not be necessary, but if you see messages 
about "Permission denied" or a bash error about bad formatting, you may 
want to try one (or both) of the following: </p>

<p>You may need to add executable 
permissions to the script for it to run correctly: 
<pre class="term">bob@12335:/scratch$ chmod +x exec.sh</pre>
</p>

<p>Windows users who are using a bash script may
also need to run the following two commands: 
<pre class="term">bob@12335:/scratch$ cat exec.sh | tr -d \\r > temp.sh
bob@12335:/scratch$ mv temp.sh exec.sh </pre>
Replace <code>exec.sh</code> with the name of your own executable.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When your test is done, type "exit" to leave the container: 
<pre class="term">bob@12335:/scratch$ exit</pre>
</p>

<p>If the program didn't work, try searching for the cause of the error 
messages, or email CHTC's Research Computing Facilitators. </p>

<p>If your local test did run successfully, you are now ready to set up 
your Docker job to run on CHTC.
