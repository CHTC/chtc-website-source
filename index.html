### [UW Research Computing](uw-research-computing)
CHTC manages over 20,000 cores and dozens of GPUs for the UW-Madison
campus; this resource, which is free and shared, aims to advance the
mission of the University of Wisconsin in support of the Wisconsin
Idea.  Researchers can place their workloads on an access point at
CHTC and utilize the resources at CHTC, across the campus, and across
the nation.

### Research Facilitation
CHTC’s Research Facilitation team empowers researchers to utilize computing to achieve
their goals.  The Research Facilitation approach emphasizes teaching users skills and
methodologies to manage & automate workloads on resources like those at CHTC, the campus,
or across the world.
