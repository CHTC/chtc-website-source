The Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) supports a variety scalable computing 
resources and services for UW-affiliated researchers and their collaborators, including 
high-throughput computing (HTC) <i>and</i>, tightly-couple computations (e.g. message 
passing interface, or "MPI"), high-memory, and GPUs. CHTC compute systems and personnel are 
funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, 
the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Morgridge Institute for Research, 
and various grants from the university.  
<p class="bigpara">
Standard access to CHTC resources are provided to <em>all</em> UW-Madison researchers, <em>free of charge</em>.
Even external collaborators with an on-campus sponsor may be given access to resources. We also offer
 hardware buy-in options for priority access to computing capacity on a case-by-case basis, though
 standard access is more than sufficient for the vast majority of CHTC users.

is the shared utilization of autonomous computational resources toward a common goal,
where all the elements are optimized for maximizing computational 
throughput

		<h2>HTCondor project</h2>

		<img src = "images/condor.png">

		<p>
		The HTCondor project provides the globally-used HTCondor software that powers the CHTC's <i>HTC resources</i>. HTCondor enables the CHTC to
		maximize job throughput for many simultaneous users, each with different needs. It supports
		complex workflows, the ability to take checkpoints and then resume jobs, and it enables access
		to additional computing resources across the globe, like the Open Science Grid.

		<h2>Open Science Grid</h2>

		<img src = "images/osg.png">

		<p>
		The Open Science Grid (OSG) is a high-throughput computing infrastructure that supports science across the country. 
		It is an expanding alliance of more than 100 universities, national laboratories, 
		scientific collaborations, and software developers, all combining their computational resources with one 
		another for maximal throughput of large-scale computational work. 
		CHTC users have automatica and FREE access to OSG's considerable computing and storage resources.

		<h2>NEOS Online Optimization Service</h2>

		<img src = "images/neos.png">

		<p>
		NEOS Online Optimization Service is a publicly-available, high-throughput computing infrastructure that provides solvers for a variety of
		optimization problems. It also provides background information on the field of optimization,
		in general, as well as case studies that provide an understanding
		of optimization problems and approaches to solving them.
