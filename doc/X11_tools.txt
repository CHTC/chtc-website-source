_1.  _I_N_T_R_O_D_U_C_T_I_O_N

   _I_m_a_k_e, _c_p_p, and _m_a_k_e_d_e_p_e_n_d are not part  of	_c_o_n_d_o_r,	 but
   you	will  need  correctly working copies of	all three to
   build  _c_o_n_d_o_r.   _I_m_a_k_e  is	a   program   for   building
   "Makefiles"	which are customized for a particular set of
   hardware, software, and local environment.  _I_m_a_k_e  accom-
   plishes  much of this task by using _c_p_p to expand macros.
   Since _i_m_a_k_e makes certain assumptions about the operation
   of  _c_p_p  which  will	not be true in all installations, it
   may be necessary to build a customized  _c_p_p	for  _i_m_a_k_e'_s
   use.	 _M_a_k_e_d_e_p_e_n_d is a program for generating	dependencies
   in "Makefiles" for C	programs which include header files.
   Since  some	versions  of _m_a_k_e_d_e_p_e_n_d	do not parse certain
   _c_p_p	directives  correctly,	you  may  need	the  version
   included here even if you already have _m_a_k_e_d_e_p_e_n_d.

   All three of	these programs are included in the _X_1_1	dis-
   tribution,  and  are	 available from	MIT.  If you already
   have	X11, you should	already	have these  programs  avail-
   able.  They are included here for your convenience in the
   event you do	not have  X11.	 Instructions  for  building
   these  programs are included	in the X11 distribution, but
   those instructions assume you want  to  build  the  whole
   distribution.   These  instructions	are intended to	be a
   "direct path" to building just these	three programs.	 The
   _c_o_n_d_o_r developers assume no responsibility for their	com-
   pleteness, correctness, etc.

    (2)	  To build correct Makefiles, _i_m_a_k_e  must  determine
	  which	 platform,  (both  hardware  and  variant of
	  UNIX), it is running on.  It	depends	 on  certain
	  unique strings being defined by your local version
	  of _c_p_p to do this.  If your  local  _c_p_p  does	 not
	  define  the  strings	which _i_m_a_k_e expects, you can
	  build	a custom version of _i_m_a_k_e  which  will	pass
	  those	 strings to _c_p_p	by using "-D<string>" on the
	  command line.	 Some hardware platforms are  unique
	  enough  that	the  unix variation is implicit.  In
	  other	 cases	two  strings  are  used.   Determine
	  whether  your	 local	_c_p_p  defines  the  necessary
	  strings to identify your platform.   The  expected
	  strings are as follows:

    (3)	  If you need to customize your	_i_m_a_k_e to  pass	such
	  strings to _c_p_p:

	a.   To	"Makefile.ini" add "-D<PLATFORM_ID>" to	 the
	     CFLAGS  macro,  where <PLATFORM_ID> is replaced
	     by	any reasonable name for	your platform.

	b.   To	"imakemdep.h" in the "cpp_argv"	 definition,
	     add

		 #ifdef	<PLATFORM_ID>
		      "-D<PlatformId>",
		 #endif

	     where <PLATFORM_ID> matches the definition	 you
	     added   to	  "Makefile.ini"   and	<PlatformId>
	     matches the appropriate string(s) listed in the
	     above  table.   Note,  if	two  identifiers are
	     listed above, you will have to  add  two  lines
	     here.

	 (4)   On AIX 3.1.5 platforms, you will	also need to
	       add   "_BSD"   to   the	 CFLAGS	  macro	  in
	       "Makefile.ini".

	 (5)   Compile	 _i_m_a_k_e	 by   running	 "make	  -f
	       Makefile.ini".

_3.  _B_U_I_L_D_I_N_G _C_P_P

    (1)	  Some versions	of _c_p_p will not	accept "/**/"  as  a
	  zero length separator.  This will cause constructs
	  like

	      /**/# Makefile comment line

	  to be	flagged	as errors.  If this is the case	with
	  your _c_p_p, you	will need to build a special version
	  to use with _i_m_a_k_e.  Just try running such  a	line
	  through  your	 local	version	 of _c_p_p	to determine
	  whether you have the problem.

    (2)	  If you do need the special _c_p_p, go  into  the	 _c_p_p
	  directory  and  build	it.  Hopefully no customiza-
	  tion will be needed.

_4.  _M_A_K_E_D_E_P_E_N_D

    (1)	  You will also	need a correctly working version  of
	  "makedepend".	  This program reads a set of source
	  files	along with the flags which will	be given  to
	  the C	compiler when those sources are	compiled and
	  generates a set of dependence	lines to be added to
	  the local Makefile.

	  There	are some versions  of  this  program  around
	  which	incorrectly process lines of the form:

	  #if <expression>

	  Since	condor uses this  construct  extensively  to
	  include  the	correct	 header	 files for different
	  platforms, you will need a correctly working	ver-
	  sion.	  A shell script version called	"mdepend.sh"
	  is included here.  It	is much	slower that the	com-
	  piled	version, but should work correctly.
