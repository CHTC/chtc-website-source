So, you have an account on a submit node, and you are ready to run your
first job in the CHTC. As we described in [Our
Approach](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/approach.shtml), the CHTC is a
collection of distributed resources. The magic that enables you to run
jobs on these resources is software, called
[HTCondor](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/), developed at the
UW-Madison.

**1. Let\'s first do, and then ask why**
====================================

Rather than having you read a bunch of stuff before hand, let\'s just
run some jobs so you can see what happens, and we\'ll provide some
additional discussion along the way. 

We are going to run the traditional
\'hello world\' program with a CHTC twist. In order to demonstrate the
distributed resource nature of the CHTC, we will produce a \'Hello
CHTC\' message 3 times, where each time is its own job. Since you are
not directly invoking the execution of each job, you need to tell
HTCondor *how* to run the jobs for you. The information needed is placed
into a *submit file*, which defines variables that describe the set of
jobs.

***Note: You must be logged into an HTCondor submit machine for the
following example to work***

**1.** Copy the highlighted text below, and paste it into file called
`hello-chtc.sub`, the submit file, in your home directory on the submit
machine.

``` {.sub}
# hello-chtc.sub
# My very first HTCondor submit file
#
# Specify the HTCondor Universe (vanilla is the default and is used
#  for almost all jobs), the desired name of the HTCondor log file,
#  and the desired name of the standard error file.  
#  Wherever you see $(Cluster), HTCondor will insert the queue number
#  assigned to this set of jobs at the time of submission.
universe = vanilla
log = hello-chtc_$(Cluster).log
error = hello-chtc_$(Cluster)_$(Process).err
#
# Specify your executable (single binary or a script that runs several
#  commands), arguments, and a files for HTCondor to store standard
#  output (or "screen output").
#  $(Process) will be a integer number for each job, starting with "0"
#  and increasing for the relevant number of jobs.
executable = hello-chtc.sh
arguments = $(Process)
output = hello-chtc_$(Cluster)_$(Process).out
#
# Specify that HTCondor should transfer files to and from the
#  computer where each job runs. The last of these lines *would* be
#  used if there were any other files needed for the executable to run.
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
# transfer_input_files = file1,/absolute/pathto/file2,etc
#
# Tell HTCondor what amount of compute resources
#  each job will need on the computer where it runs.
request_cpus = 1
request_memory = 1GB
request_disk = 1MB
#
# Tell HTCondor to run 3 instances of our job:
queue 3
```

> For a \"template\" version of this submit file without the comments,
> [click here](/files/template.sub).

**2.** Now, create the executable that we specified above: copy the text
below and paste it into a file called `hello-chtc.sh`

``` {.file}
#!/bin/bash
#
# hello-chtc.sh
# My very first CHTC job
#
# print a 'hello' message to the job's terminal output:
echo "Hello CHTC from Job $1 running on `whoami`@`hostname`"
#
# keep this job running for a few minutes so you'll see it in the queue:
sleep 180
```

When HTCondor runs this executable, it will pass the \$(Process) value
for each job and `hello-chtc.sh` will insert that value for \"\$1\",
above.

**3.** Now, submit your job to the queue using `condor_submit`:


```
[alice@submit]$ condor_submit hello-chtc.sub 
```
{:.term}

The `condor_submit` command actually submits your jobs to HTCondor. If
all goes well, you will see output from the `condor_submit` command that
appears as:

``` 
Submitting job(s).....
3 job(s) submitted to cluster 436950.
```
{:.term}

**4.** To check on the status of your jobs, run the following command:

{:.term}
``` 
[alice@submit]$ condor_q
```


(If you want to see everyone\'s jobs, use `condor_q -all`.)

The output of `condor_q` should look like this:

``` 
-- Schedd: submit-2.chtc.wisc.edu : <128.104.101.92:9618?... @ 04/05/19 15:35:17
OWNER  BATCH_NAME     SUBMITTED   DONE   RUN    IDLE  TOTAL  JOB_IDS
alice  ID: 436950     4/5  15:34     _     _       3      3  436950.0-2

3 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 3 idle, 0 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
```
{:.term}

You can run the `condor_q` command periodically to see the progress of
your jobs. By default, `condor_q` shows jobs grouped into batches by
batch name (if provided), or executable name. To show all of your jobs
on individual lines, add the `-nobatch` option. For more details on this
option, and other options to `condor_q`, see our [condor\_q
guide](/condor_q.shtml).

> **Potential Failures**\
>
> If your jobs go on hold and you usually use a Windows laptop or
> desktop, please see [this page](/dos-unix.shtml) for a potential
> diagnosis and solution.


**5.** When your jobs complete after a few minutes, they\'ll leave the
queue. If you do a listing of your home directory with the command
`ls -l`, you should see something like:

``` {.term}
[alice@submit]$ ls -l
total 28
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice    0 Apr  5 15:37 hello-chtc_436950_0.err
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice   60 Apr  5 15:37 hello-chtc_436950_0.out
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice    0 Apr  5 15:37 hello-chtc_436950_1.err
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice   60 Apr  5 15:37 hello-chtc_436950_1.out
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice    0 Apr  5 15:37 hello-chtc_436950_2.err
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice   60 Apr  5 15:37 hello-chtc_436950_2.out
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice alice 5111 Apr  5 15:37 hello-chtc_436950.log
-rw-rw-r-- 1 alice alice  241 Apr  5 15:33 hello-chtc.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 alice alice 1387 Apr  5 15:33 hello-chtc.sub
```

**Useful information is provided in the user log and the output files.**

HTCondor creates a transaction log of everything that happens to your
jobs. Looking at the log file is very useful for debugging problems that
may arise. An excerpt from `hello-chtc_845638.log` produced due the
submission of the 3 jobs will look something like this:

``` 

000 (436950.000.000) 04/05 15:34:33 Job submitted from host: <128.104.101.92:9618?addrs=128.104...>

```
{:.file}

And, if you look at one of the output files, you should see something
like this:

``` 
Hello CHTC from Job 0 running on alice@e389.chtc.wisc.edu
```{:.file}
  
**Congratulations.** You\'ve run your first jobs in the CHTC!


**2. What Else?**
=============

A. Removing Jobs
----------------

To remove a specific job, specify the job ID nubmer from the queue
(format: Cluster.Process). Example:

``` 
[alice@submit]$ condor_rm 845638.0
```
{:.term}

You can even remove all of the jobs of the same cluster by specifying
only the Cluster value for that batch. 
To remove **all of your jobs**:

``` 
[alice@submit]$ condor_rm $USER
```
{:.term}

**B. The Importance of Testing**
----------------------------

1\. **Examining Job Success.** Within the log file, you can see
information about the completion of each job, including a system error
code (as seen in \"return value 0\"). You can use this code, as well as
information in your \".err\" file and other output files, to determine
what issues your job(s) may have had, if any. 

2\. **Determining Memory
and Disk Requirements.** The log file also indicates how much memory and
disk each job used, so that you can first test a few jobs before
submitting many more with more accurate request values. When you request
too little, your jobs will be \"evicted\" from the computer they\'re
running on, and HTCondor will have to try to rerun them (maybe many
times) until it requests enough for you. When you request too much, your
jobs may not match to as many available \"slots\" as they could
otherwise, and your overall throughput will suffer in that case as well.

3\. **Determining Run Time.** Depending on how long each of your jobs are
(determined by examining when the job began executing and when it
completed), you can send your jobs to even more computers than are in
the CHTC Pool (where your jobs will run, by default). Refer to the table
below for tips on how to send your jobs to the rest of the UW Grid and
to the national [Open Science Grid](http://www.opensciencegrid.org/).



**C. Getting the Right Resources**
------------------------------

Be sure to always add or modify the following lines in your submit
files, as appropriate, and after running a few tests.

  {:.gtable}
  | Submit file entry  | Resources your jobs will run on |
  | --- | --- |
  | `request\_cpus = `*`cpus`*  |  Matches each job to a computer \"slot\" with at least this many CPU cores. |
  | `request\_disk = `*_`kilobytes`_*  |  Matches each job to a slot with at least this much disk space, in units of KB. |
  |`request\_memory = `*_`megabytes`_*  |  Matches each job to a slot with at least this much memory (RAM), in units of MB.|
  |`+WantFlocking = true`  |  Also send jobs to other HTCondor Pools on campus (UW Grid) <br> Good for jobs that are less than \~8 hours, or checkpoint at least that frequently.|
  |`+WantGlideIn = true`  |  Also send jobs to the Open Science Grid (OSG).<br> Good for jobs that are less than \~8 hours (or checkpoint at least that frequently), and have been tested for portability. (Contact Us for more details).|

Learn more about sending jobs to the UW Grid and OSG in our [Scaling Beyond Local HTC Capacity](/scaling-htc.shtml) guide.


D. Now, time for a little homework
----------------------------------

To get the most of the CHTC, you will want to have a good understanding
of how HTCondor works. **We HIGHLY recommend browsing the latest
[HTCondor User Tutorial](https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/1325/other-view?view=standard#20180521.detailed)
from the international HTCondor Week conference.** 

[Our full set of CHTC
online guides is available here.](guides.shtml) Remember to [Get
Help](get-help.shtml) whenever you have questions or issues. That\'s
what CHTC staff are here for. 

The full HTCondor manual is comprehensive
and lengthy, and Googling \"HTCondor examples\" may lead you to examples
that really only work on another campus\'s HTCondor system. You can
always dig into more details as you become more experienced, but the
below pages of the manual may be a good place to start if you like
manuals:
