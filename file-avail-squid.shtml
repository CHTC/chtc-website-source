<h1>SQUID Web Proxy</h1>

<p>CHTC maintains a SQUID web proxy from which pre-staged input files 
and executables can be downloaded into jobs using CHTC's proxy HTTP address.</p>

<h2>1. Applicability</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Intended Use:</dt> <dd>The SQUID web proxy is best for cases where many jobs will use 
the same large file (or few files), including large software. It 
is not good for cases when each of many jobs needs a <i>different</i> large input file, 
in which case <a href="/file-avail-gluster">"Gluster"</a> 
should be used. Remember that you're always better off by pre-splitting a 
large input file into smaller job-specific files if each job only needs some of 
the large files's data. If each job needs a large set of many files, you should create a 
<code>.tar.gz</code> file containing all the files, and this file will still need to be less than 1 GB.</dd>
<dt>Access to SQUID:</dt> <dd>is granted upon request to chtc@cs.wisc.edu.  A user on CHTC submit
 servers may will be granted a user directory within <code>/squid</code>, which users should transfer
 data into via the CHTC transfer server (transfer.chtc.wisc.edu). As for all CHTC
 file space, users should minimize the amount of data on the SQUID web proxy,
 and should clean files from the <code>/squid</code> location regularly. CHTC staff reserve
 the right to remove any file from <code>/squid</code> when needed to preserve availability
 and performance for all users.</dd>
<dt>Advantages:</dt> <dd>Files placed on the SQUID web proxy can be downloaded by 
jobs running anywhere, because the files are world-readable.</dd>
<dt><b>Limitations and Policies</b>:</dt> <dd><ul> 
	<li>SQUID cannot be used for job output, as there is 
		no way to change files in SQUID from within a job. </li>
	<li>SQUID is also only capable of delivering individual files up to 
	1 GB in size. </li>
	<li>A change you make to a file within your <code>/squid</code> directory 
	may not take effect immediately on the SQUID web proxy if you use the same 
	filename. Therefore, it is important to use a <b>new filename</b> when 
	replacing a file in your <code>/squid</code> directory.</li>
	<li>Jobs should still ALWAYS and ONLY be submitted from within the 
	user's <code>/home</code> location.</li>	
	<li>Only the "http" address should be listed in the 
	"<code>transfer_input_files</code>" line of the submit file. File locations 
	starting with "<code>/squid</code>" should NEVER be listed in the submit file.</li>
	<li>Users should only have data in /squid that is being use for currently-queued jobs; 
	CHTC provides no back ups of any data in CHTC systems, and our staff reserve the right 
	to remove any data causing issues. It is the responsibility of users to keep copies of 
	all essential data in preparation for potential data loss or file system corruption.</li> </ul>
	</dd>
<dt>Data Security:</dt> <dd>Files placed in SQUID can only be edited by the owner 
of the user directory within <code>/squid</code>, but will end up being world-readable on the 
SQUID web proxy in order to be readily downloadable by jobs (with the proper 
HTTP address); thus, large files that should be "private" should not be placed 
in your user directory in <code>/squid</code>, and should instead use CHTC's <a 
href="file-avail-gluster">Gluster</a> location for large-file staging.</dd>

<h2>2. Using SQUID to Deliver Input Files</h2>

<ol type="A">
	<a name="request"></a>
	<li> <b>Request a directory in SQUID</b>. Write to chtc@cs.wisc.edu describing 
	the data you'd like to place in SQUID, and indicating your username and 
	submit server hostname (i.e. submit-5.chtc.wisc.edu).</li>

	<a name="place"></a>
	<li> <b>Place files within your <code>/squid/username</code> directory</b> via a CHTC transfer server (if 
	from your laptop/desktop) or on the submit server.
</br></br>
	From your laptop/desktop:
	<pre class="term">[username@computer]$ scp <i>large_file.tar.gz</i> <i>username</i>@transfer.chtc.wisc.edu:/squid/<i>username</i>/</pre>
	 
	If the file already exists within your /home directory on a submit server:	
	<pre class="term">[username@submit]$ cp <i>large_file.tar.gz</i> /squid/<i>username</i>/</pre>

	Check the file from the submit server:

	<pre class="term">[username@submit]$ ls /squid/<i>username</i>/</pre>
	</li>


	<a name="have"></a>
	<li><b>Have HTCondor download the file to the working job</b> using 
	the <code>http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID</code> address in the
	transfer_input_files line of your submit file: <br>

	<pre class="sub">transfer_input_files = <i>other_file1</i>,<i>other_file2</i>,http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/<i>username</i>/lg_file.txt</pre>
	<b>Important:</b>Make sure to replace "username" with your username in the above address.
	 All other files should be staged
	before job submission.<br>
	<br>
	If your large file is a <code>.tar.gz</code> file that untars to 
	include other <i>files</i>, remember to remove such files before the end 
	of the job; otherwise, HTCondor will think that such files are new
	output that needs to be transferred back to the submit server. 
	(HTCondor will not automatically transfer back <i>directories</i>.)
