title: CHTC Job Policy Description
---

These policies relate to the general resources which were funded by
**WARF** to which **UW** researchers have equal access. There are
additional **OWNED** resources in the center which are made available
for Opportunistics use.

-   A user may recycle a slot for up to 12 hours without having to
    renegotiate for the slot. No single job will be interrupted before
    it has run for 24 hours. If(for any reason) a job is suspended, this
    does not count against its run time.
-   A user may request a whole machine for use (ie a whole machine
    slot). \~45 of the current 200 machines are available in this
    capcity. When a user claims a machine, their job will be initially
    suspended while jobs on any single-core slots complete. Like
    single-core slots, no whole machine job will be interrupted before
    it has run for 24 hours.
-   Groups of users are identified by their associated project. (One
    user working on one project, counts as one group). This is used tp
    make accounting more readable.
-   User Priority Factors in this pool are adjusted to attempt to avoid
    a group getting a larger share of resources only because it has more
    users (or logical identities) submitting jobs. This policy currently
    weights all identified groups equal to the weight of one individual
    user.
-   User priority is calculated with a 3 day half life.
