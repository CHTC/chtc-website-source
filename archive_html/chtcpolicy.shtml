title: CHTC Job Policy Description
---

<P>
These policies relate to the general resources which were funded by <b>WARF</b>
to which <b>UW</b> researchers have equal access. There are additional <b>OWNED</b>
resources in the center which are made available for Opportunistics use.
</P>
<ul>
<li>
A user may recycle a slot for up to 12 hours without having to renegotiate
for the slot. No single job will be interrupted before it has run for 24 hours. If(for any reason)
a job is suspended, this does not count against its run time.
</li>
<li>
A user may request a whole machine for use (ie a whole machine slot). 
~45 of the current 200 machines are available in this capcity. When 
a user claims a machine, their job will be initially suspended while
jobs on any single-core slots complete. Like single-core slots, no 
whole machine job will be interrupted before it has run for 24 hours.
</li>
<li>
Groups of users are identified by their associated project. (One user
working on one project, counts as one group). This is used tp make accounting more readable.
</li>
<li>
User Priority Factors in this pool are adjusted to attempt to avoid a group getting a larger
share of resources only because it has more users (or logical identities) submitting jobs. This
policy currently weights all identified groups equal to the weight of one individual user.
</li>
<li> 
User priority is calculated with a 3 day half life.
</li>
</ul>
