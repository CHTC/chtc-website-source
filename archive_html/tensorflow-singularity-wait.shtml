title: Running Tensorflow Jobs
---

<p>This guide describes how to use a pre-built Tensorflow environment 
(implemented as a <a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov/">Singularity container</a>)
to run Tensorflow jobs in CHTC and on the Open Science Grid (OSG).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Typically, software in CHTC jobs is installed or compiled locally by 
individual users and then brought along to each job, either using the 
default file transfer or our SQUID web server.  However, another option 
is to use a <i>container</i> system, where the software is installed in a <i>container 
image</i>.  CHTC (and the OSG) have capabilities to access and start  
containers and run jobs inside them.  One container option available in CHTC is 
<a href="/docker-jobs.shtml">Docker</a>; another is Singularity.  </p>

<p>In CHTC, our Singularity support consists of running jobs inside a 
pre-made Singularity container with an installation of Tensorflow.  
This Singularity set up is very flexible: it is accessible both 
in CHTC and on the Open Science Grid, 
and can be used to run Tensorflow either with CPUs or GPUs.  This guide 
starts with a basic CPU example, but then goes on to describe how to use 
the Singularity Tensorflow container for GPUs, and also how to run on 
the Open Science Grid.  </p>

<h2>1. Basic Tensorflow Job Template</h2>

<p>The submit file for jobs that use the Tensorflow singularity container 
will look similar to other CHTC jobs, except for the additional Singularity 
options seen below.</p>

<b>Submit File</b><br>

<pre class="sub">
# Typical submit file options
universe = vanilla
log = <i>$(Cluster).$(Process)</i>.log
error = <i>$(Cluster).$(Process)</i>.err
output = <i>$(Cluster).$(Process)</i>.out

# Fill in with your own script, arguments and input files
# Note that you don't need to transfer any software
executable = <i>run_tensorflow</i>.sh
arguments =
transfer_input_files = 

# Singularity settings
+SingularityImage = "/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/tensorflow:latest"
Requirements = HAS_SINGULARITY == True

# Resource requirements
request_cpus = <i>1</i>
request_memory = <i>2GB</i>
request_disk = <i>4GB</i>

# Number of jobs
queue 1
</pre>

<b>Sample Executable (Wrapper Script)</b>

<p>Your job will be running inside a container that has Tensorflow installed, 
so there should be no need to set any environment variables.  </p>

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

# your own code here 
python <i>test.py</i>
</pre>

<h2>2. CPUs vs GPUs</h2>

<p>The submit file above use a CPU-enabled version of Tensorflow.  In order 
to take advantage of GPUs, make the following changes to the submit file above: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Request GPUs in addition to CPUs: 
  <pre class="sub">request_gpus = 1</pre></li>
  <li>Change the Singularity image to tensorflow with GPUs: 
  <pre class="sub">+SingularityImage = "/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/tensorflow-gpu:latest"</pre></li>
  <li>Add a GPU card requirement to the requirements line: 
  <pre class="sub">requirements = HAS_SINGULARITY == True && CUDACapability >= 3</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about GPUs and how GPU jobs work in CHTC, see our 
<a href="/gpu-jobs.shtml">GPU Jobs guide</a>. 

<blockquote>
<b>Limited GPU availablity in CHTC</b> <br>
This Singularity/Tensorflow functionality is not yet available on
CHTC's newer GPUs with a sufficiently high CUDA Capability.  Therefore, 
for now, the best way to use this Singularity/Tensorflow environment with GPUs is by 
running jobs on the Open Science Grid (see below).  We are working on having Singularity 
support on all CHTC GPUs soon.

<h2>3. Running on OSG</h2>

<p>This Tensorflow environment can also be run on the Open Science Grid, 
or OSG, either as the CPU or GPU version.</p>

<p>For more details on accessing the OSG, see 
<a href="/scaling-htc.shtml">our guide for running outside CHTC, sections
3 and 4,</a>.
<!-- and for GPUs on the OSG, 
see the final section of <a href="/gpu-jobs.shtml">our GPU guide.</a>.-->
