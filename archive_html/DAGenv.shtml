title: Submitting Jobs Using the ChtcRun Package
---

<p>To facilitate the submission of large batches of jobs, especially
 batches for Matlab, Python, and R, the CHTC has created the ChtcRun
 package of scripts, files, and directories that will allow you to easily
 construct your own HTCondor workflow (or "DAG" batch). By following the ordered
 set of directions given here, you'll be able to easily set up and run
 a set of high-throughput computing jobs on CHTC-available resources,
 including those outside of the CHTC HTCondor Pool in the UW Grid and
 national Open Science Grid.
</p>

<ol>



<li>From within your home directory on the submit node, in a directory of your choice, 
download the ChtcRun package:
<pre>wget <a href="/downloads/ChtcRun.tar.gz">http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/downloads/ChtcRun.tar.gz</a></pre>

<p>Unpack the ChtcRun package.  
This will create a <code>ChtcRun</code> subdirectory.
<pre>tar xzf ChtcRun.tar.gz</pre>
After unpacking the package,
within the <code>ChtcRun</code> directory will be:
</p>

  <ul class="tight">
	  <li> <code>chtcjobwrapper</code> </li>
	  <li> <code>process.template</code> </li>
	  <li> <code>postjob.template</code> </li>
	  <li> <code>mkdag</code> </li>
	  <li> <code>Matlabin/</code> (example Matlab setup) </li>
	  <li> <code>Rin/</code> (example R setup) </li>
	  <li> other directories and files </li>
  </ul>

<p>
You do not need to download a separate copy of <code>ChtcRun</code> for every 
batch of jobs you submit - each project will be submitted from its own directory 
from within <code>ChtcRun</code>.  However, the operations of downloading and unpacking <code>ChtcRun</code>
may be repeated to
obtain updated versions of the scripts and supporting files.
Doing so will overwrite existing, but updated material,
without harming other files and directories already in place. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
Stage files specific to your set of jobs into correctly-named directories
within <code>ChtcRun</code>.

<p>
<b>For Matlab, Python, and R jobs, it is first essential to have completed       
 the steps to compile your code dependencies, according to our <a href ="http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/MATLABandR.shtml">
"Compiling Matlab, Python and R Code" page.</a></b>
</p>

<p>Make a directory 
within <code>ChtcRun</code>
to house the project's input files and executables.
For purposes of this example, assume that the directory has been named 
<code>proj1data</code>, which is otherwise equivalent to the example
<code>Matlabin</code> and <code>Rin</code> directories.
</p>

<p>Within <code>proj1data</code>, create one directory 
for each job to be run.
Within each of these run-specific directories, 
place the input files used for that specific job.  
If the work does not require any per-job input files, 
then nothing will be in these directories.
The files might include input files and parameter files.
These directories can be given any name, 
but the file names may not contain whitespace characters, notably spaces,
in their name.
And, the file name <code>shared</code> is already
used for the files shared among job submissions.
</p>

<p>
Each of these directories will create an individual job within
the single DAG.
When the job starts,
its current working directory on the machine where the job executes
will contain copies of all files placed in the run-specific directory 
on the submit machine,
as well as copies of all files placed in the 
<code>shared</code> directory on the submit machine.
</p>

<p>Input files, shared libraries, and all executables shared by
all jobs go into a directory with the name 
<code>shared</code>.
Create the directory <code>shared</code> within
<code>proj1data</code>.
Place the executable and any input files common to the 
set of jobs that will be submitted into directory <code>shared</code>.  
The <code>shared</code> directory will not become an individual job.
</p>

<p>
For example, you might want to run several jobs on data you have for 
several midwestern states, where there is one job per state.
Each state has its own input data file,
called  <code>state.dat</code>.
There is also a shared input data file of US-wide averages for comparison,
called <code>us.dat</code>,
as well as a single executable (program).
For each job submission, assume this program 
<code>compare-states</code>
will compare contents of <code>us.dat</code> to 
<code>state.dat</code>.
Given this, a portion of the directory hierarchy might look like this:
</p>

<pre>proj1data/
   shared/
      us.dat
      compare-states
   wi/
      state.dat
   il/
      state.dat
   mn/
      state.dat
   ia/
      state.dat
</pre>

</li>

<li>
Modify <code>process.template</code> (a template submit file) in <code>ChtcRun</code>
 with respect to the following lines:</br>
<pre>
request_cpus = 1	(or other integer)
request_disk = (insert KB value)
request_memory = (insert MB value)
+WantFlocking = true	(to send jobs shorter than 4 hours to the UW Grid)
+WantGlidein = true	(to send jobs shorter than 2 hours to the OSG)
</pre>
<p>
<b> If you are not aware of how much disk or memory your jobs need,
 it is ESSENTIAL to first test 5-10 jobs</b>, and then look at the resulting
 <code>process.log</code> file for each test job to determine the
 amounts that should be requested for your jobs.</br>
For more information on testing, Flocking, and Glidein, please see the
 bottom of our <a href = "http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/helloworld.shtml">"Run Your First HTC Jobs" guide</a>.

</li>

<li>
With a current working directory of <code>ChtcRun</code>,
run <code>mkdag</code>
with a job-specific set of command line arguments.
The output from from running <code>mkdag</code>
will be a directory to hold eventual output from running
the project's job(s),
as well as control files:
a DAG input file for describing the DAG 
(called <code>mydag.dag</code>)
and an HTCondor job submit description files for each of the node jobs within
the DAG.
One of the command line arguments to 
<code>mkdag</code>
will specify the name of this directory.

<p>
<b>The command line arguments to <code>mkdag</code> are viewable by running the
 following command</b>, which includes full <code>mkdag</code> commands for the
 <code>Matlabin</code>, <code>Rin</code>, <code>Pythonin</code>, and <code>Binin</code>
 examples that come within <code>ChtcRun</code>:
<pre>./mkdag --help</pre>
<ul>

<li><code>--cmdtorun=NameOfJobExecutable</code>
<br> This required argument identifies which file within the <code>shared</code>
directory should be executed.
It should be only the base name of the file 
(for example, <code>compare-states</code>); 
do not include directory information.
</li>

<li> <code>--data=DirectoryName</code>
<br> This required argument identifies the relative path to and
name of the directory that contains the 
<code>shared</code> directory.
The path is specified as relative to the directory containing the 
<code>mkdag</code> script.
The string used instead of 
<code>DirectoryName</code>
for this presented example would be
<code>proj1data</code>.
</li>

<li> <code>--outputdir=DirectoryName</code>
<br> This required argument identifies where the output from your 
jobs will be placed.  
This is the relative path to and
specifies a name for the directory within 
<code>ChtcRun</code>
that will be created, and within which the directories and files
produced by the  <code>mkdag</code>  script will go.
Do not create this directory before running
<code>mkdag</code>.  
The directory will be created by <code>mkdag</code>, 
and it will contain one subdirectory for each of the jobs within the DAG.
</li>

<li> <code>--pattern=SubString</code>
<br> This required argument helps identify if a job ran successfully.
For a variety of reasons, 
we cannot necessarily trust the return code from MATLAB or R 
to tell us if the job was successful.  
We determine if a job was successful by checking if at least one 
file was created that includes the pattern "SubString" in it's 
filename, for each HTCondor job submitted.
This check is identical to running
<pre>ls *SubString*
</pre>
in a job's output folder after the job completes to see that at least one file is returned.
</li>

<li> <code>--parg=ArgumentString</code>
<br> This optional argument identifies a command line argument that
is to be passed to each invocation (as an HTCondor job) of the executable.
This argument will be listed multiple times to define more than one
command line argument. Optionally, you can use "--parg=<i>unique</i>" to 
pass the name of the job directory as an argument to your code for each job.
</li>

<li><code>--type</code>
<br>The <code>--type</code> argument is required,
and must be set to one of 3 values.

	<ul>

	<li><code>--type=Matlab</code>
	<br>For MATLAB jobs.  
	It ensures that necessary MATLAB supporting libraries are made 
	available to the job.

	<li> <code>--type=R</code>
	<br>For R jobs.   
	It ensures that the R runtime environment is made available to the job.

	<li><code>--type=Other</code>

<br>For jobs that are neither MATLAB or R. "Other" <i>should</i>
 be specified for Python jobs.
	</ul>
</li>

<li>
 <code>--version=VersionNumber</code>
<br>This argument is required for R and some Matlab jobs.
It specifies the version of R needed.
Possible values are listed below:
  <ul class="tight">
  <li> <code>sl6-R-2.10.1</code> (version R-2.10.1 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>sl6-R-2.13.1</code> (version R-2.13.1 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>sl6-R-2.14.1</code> (version R-2.14.1 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>sl6-R-2.15.1</code> (version R-2.15.1 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>sl6-R-2.15.2</code> (version R-2.15.1 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>sl6-R-2.15.3</code> (version R-2.15.1 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>sl6-R-3.0.1</code> (version R-3.0.1 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>sl6-R-3.1.0</code> (version R-3.1.0 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>sl6-R-3.2.0</code> (version R-3.2.0 on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>R2011b</code>
        (Matlab version R2011b on Scientific Linux) </li>
  <li> <code>R2013b</code>
	(Matlab version R2013b on Scientific Linux) </li>
  </ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, assume that the <code>compare-states</code> program
is a compiled MATLAB program that takes two arguments: 
the files to compare.  
It produces a file called <code>output.dat</code>.  
The command line for <code>mkdag</code>:

<pre>./mkdag --cmdtorun=compare-states --data=proj1data \
  --outputdir=proj1output --pattern=output.dat --parg=us.dat \
  --parg=state.dat --type=Matlab 
</pre>

<p>(The backslashes above are used to break a long command across three lines.  You can omit the backslashes and enter your command as a single line.)

</li>

<li>
From the <code>outputdir</code> directory created by the
 <code>mkdag</code> command, run
<pre>condor_submit_dag mydag.dag
</pre>
This submits and runs the batch of job(s) you setup in the 
"<code>data</code>" directory (<code>proj1data</code> in this example).
</br>
<b>Output, log, and error files for each job will also be placed
 within newly created folders for each job, within the "<code>outputdir</code>"
 you specified.</b>
</li>

</ol>
