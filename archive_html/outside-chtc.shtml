title: Accessing Additional Resources by Running Outside of CHTC
---

<p>This guide provides an introduction to running jobs outside of CHTC: 
what resources are available, why using these resources is beneficial, 
and how to use them.</p>

<h1>1. What resources are available outside CHTC?</h1>

<h2>A. The UW Grid</h2>

<p>What we call the "UW Grid" is a collection of all the groups and centers 
on campus that run their own high throughput computing pool that uses HTCondor.  
Some of these groups include departments (Biochemistry, Statistics) or large 
physics projects (IceCube, CMS).  Through agreements with these groups, jobs 
submitted in CHTC can opt into running on these other campus pools if there
is space.</p>

<p>We call sending jobs to other pools on campus <i>flocking</i>.</p>

<h2>B. The Open Science Grid (OSG)</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/">Open Science Grid (OSG)</a>
is a group of universities and research labs who have
agreed to share their unused computational resources with each other.  If a job is 
submitted from an OSG submission point, it can run in the OSG pool associated with 
that submission point.  This OSG pool is the result of going out to other members of 
the OSG and finding if they have any unused computers that are available to run jobs.
These unused computers then form a pool of resources where jobs
can go run.</p>

<p>CHTC is a member of the Open Science Grid, so our submit servers, besides sending 
jobs to CHTC computers (the default), can send jobs to the OSG.  
We call sending jobs to other institutions <i>gliding</i>.</p>

<!--<h2>What is available in the OSG?</h2>

<p>The computers available in the OSG change from day-to-day, even hour-to-hour, 
as they're basically whatever computers are not being used by other universities 
or labs or centers that belong to the OSG.</p>

<p>However, there is a command to see what's available:</p>-->

<h1>2. Why run on additional resources outside CHTC?</h1>

<p>Running on other resources in addition to CHTC has one huge benefit: size!  
The UW Grid and Open Science Grid include thousands of computers, addition to 
what's already available in CHTC.  
Most CHTC users who run on CHTC, the UW Grid, 
and the OSG can get more than 100,000 computer hours in a single day.</p>

<h1>3. Job Qualifications</h1>

<p>Not all jobs will run well outside of CHTC.  Because these jobs are running all over 
the campus or country, on computers that don't belong to us, 
they have two major requirements: <p>

<ul>
  <li><b>No "large" data</b>: All of the files for your jobs are 
  in your home directory and/or in SQUID, and 
  output files are small enough to return to your home directory (less than 2 GB). We 
  normally handle larger files in our Gluster filesystem which is only available 
  from CHTC.  </li>
  <li><b>Short or interruptable jobs</b>: Your job can run in under 8 hours -- 
  either it finishes in that amount of 
  time, or it self-checkpoints at least that frequently.  </li>
</ul>

<h1>4. Submitting Jobs to run outside CHTC</h1>

<p>If your jobs meet the characteristics above and you would like to use either the 
UW Grid or OSG to run jobs, in addition to CHTC, follow the following steps: </p>

<h2>A. Test Your Jobs</h2>

<p>You should run a small test (anywhere from 10-100 jobs) outside CHTC before 
submitting your full workflow.  To do this, take a job submission that you 
know runs successfully on CHTC.  Then add the following options: </p>

<ol>
  <li>To run on the UW Grid: <pre class="sub">+WantFlocking = true</pre></li>
  <li>To run on the OSG: <pre class="sub">+WantGlidein = true</pre></li>
  <li>To force your jobs outside of CHTC (for test purposes only!): <pre class="sub">requirements = (Poolname =!= "CHTC")</pre></li>
<li><b>For jobs running R</b> do the following:
<ol>
<li><u>In your submit file</u>, add a link that will download a package of extra libraries:
<pre class="sub">transfer_input_files = <i>other files</i>, http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/SLIBS.tar.gz</pre>
</li>
<li><u>In your executable script</u>, add these lines that unzip the library package 
and set it up in the job environment: 
<pre class="file">tar -xzf SLIBS.tar.gz
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/SS:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>We recommend that you run a separate test for the UW Grid and OSG if
you are planning to use both. 
If your submit file already has a <code>requirements = </code> line, you 
can appending the <code>Poolname</code> requirement by using a double ampersand 
(<code>&&</code>) and then the additional requirement</p>

<p>Set the job submission to run anywhere from 10 - 100 jobs, and then submit.</p>

<h2>B. Scaling Up</h2>

<p>Once you have tested your jobs and they seem to be running successfully, 
you are ready to submit a full batch of jobs that uses CHTC and the UW Grid/OSG.  Make sure your
 submit file(s) has: </p>

<ol>
  <li>If using the UW Grid: 
  <pre class="sub">+WantFlocking = true</pre></li>
  <li>If using the OSG: 
  <pre class="sub">+WantGlidein = true</pre></li>
  <li><b>REMOVE</b> the <code>Poolname</code> requirement from the test jobs.</li>
</ol>
