This January, we will be going live with a completely new HPC cluster â€“ new execute nodes, new file system, new network, and new operating
system/software modules! This is a continuation of the campus investment in a technology refresh at CHTC, started this summer with our HTC system.

We will send an email to the chtc-users mailing list when the new cluster is live. 

We are planning two FAQ sessions to go through needed transition steps and answer questions. These sessions will be offered:

- Thursday, January 19, 9:30 - 10:30am: This session will be in-person at the Researchers' Link in the Discovery Building. Meet CHTC staff at the Discovery Building frontdesk to be let upstairs.
- Tuesday, January 24, 12 - 1pm: This session will be online, please email chtc@cs.wisc.edu for the Zoom link.

No registration is required.
