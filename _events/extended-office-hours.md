<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Sign Up for our November 1st extended, in-person office hours!</p>

If youâ€™ve missed talking to the Facilitation team in-person, we will be having a special, extended, in-person office hour session on Tuesday, November 1, from 9:00am - 12:00pm CST. The <b>in-person</b> office hours will be held at the Discovery Building, 330 N. Orchard St., Room 1260. 

**[Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjjAoyuOA5Kikni0w3SfZpyF5TAOb-fZ8wBlZOLzGb16K0dg/viewform) so we can plan ahead.**

This is a chance to both get specific help (as with usual office hours) and just have a chance to work in the same space as other CHTC users and the facilitation team. Your sign up helps us plan for space and food.
