### Registration

Registration for [Throughput Computing 2023](https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2014/) is now open!

For the first time, HTCondor Week and the OSG All-Hands Meeting will join together as a single, integrated event from July 10–14 to be held at the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s [Fluno Center](https://fluno.com/). Throughput Computing 2023 is sponsored by the OSG Consortium, the HTCondor team, and the UW-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing.

This will primarily be an in-person event, but remote participation (via Zoom) for the many plenary events will also be offered.

**Registration for in-person attendance:** [Register here.](https://uw.ungerboeck.com/prod/emc00/PublicSignIn.aspx?&aat=hAc2KhMWB4wgUAGwFEqLOM9xYB4D841E2wk3wrAJ6R8%3d)

*Registration for in-person attendance closes June 15.*

### Schedule

The schedule can be found under the [General Schedule](https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2014/timetable/#20230710) section on the Throughput Computing  2023 event website. The session block topics will not change; however, there will likely be timing adjustments in the schedule as speakers are finalized.

All the topics typically covered by HTCondor Week and the OSG All-Hands Meeting will be included:

- Science Enabled by the OSPool and the HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS)
- OSG Technology
- HTCondor Technology
- HTCondor and OSG Tutorials
- State of the OSG
- Campus  Services and Perspectives

The **U.S. ATLAS and U.S. CMS high-energy physics projects** are also planning parallel OSG-related sessions during the event on Wednesday, July 12.

### Workshop Hotel Accommodations

We have arranged room blocks at a reduced rate at the Fluno Center and at two nearby hotels. We recommend you make your room reservation **ASAP**, as the number of rooms available at the reduced rate is limited (Madison is also a popular place to visit in the summer!) Please visit the [Local Arrangements](https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2014/page/55-local-arrangements) page to find information about how to book your hotel room at the reduced rate for each hotel.

**Please note:** DoubleTree Madison is the only hotel with a *free shuttle service* to and from the airport.
