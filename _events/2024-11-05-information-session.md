<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Learn about CHTC's computing 
and data services for UW-Madison affiliates at this information session!</p>

CHTC staff will present an overview of CHTC services and how these services can help 
researchers accomplish their research and computational goals. CHTC staff will also 
help attendees identify the next steps for getting started - whether that is 
getting an account, how to log in, or how to start running work. After 
the presentation, there will be time for Q+A and hands-on help from the CHTC 
Facilitation Team. 

This is the perfect opportunity for any UW Madison researcher to learn more 
about CHTC - whether you are just curious or have already gotten an account.
