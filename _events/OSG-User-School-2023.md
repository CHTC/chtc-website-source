Has your research computing outgrown your available capacity? How could access to **lots** more computing transform your research or others? If you have research workloads that can be broken into many independent, parallel computing tasks, we can help!

The OSG User School provides researchers the opportunity to learn how to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems to run large-scale computing applications at their campus or using the national-scale OSG Consortium.

To learn more about the event, check out these articles written about the OSG User School 2022:
- Read about last year's [OSG User School student lightning talks](https://osg-htc.org/spotlights/Lightning-Talks.html), where researchers showcased their work and future plans to implement HTC.
- This article spotlights [students from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/African Centers for Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data-Intensive Science (ACE) who attended this year’s OSG User School 2022](https://osg-htc.org/spotlights/NIAID-ACE-students-attend-OSG-User-School.html). Learn more about these students and their work and the ongoing collaboration between the OSG and ACE/NIAID teams.
