**Don't miss this opportunity to connect with the High Throughput Computing community.** 

You are invited to the annual Throughput Computing Week (HTC25) from June 2-6 to be held in beautiful Madison, Wisconsin. HTC25 brings together researchers, campuses, science collaborations, facilitators, administrators, government representatives, and professionals interested in high throughput computing to:

- Engage with the throughput computing community, including the [OSG Consortium](https://osg-htc.org/), [PATh](https://path-cc.io/) and [Pelican](https://pelicanplatform.org/) teams and many others contributing to HTC
- Be inspired by presentations and conversations with community leaders and contributors sharing common interests
- Learn about HTC and new developments to advance your science, your collaboration or your campus

**Registration Opens in January 2025**

### Connect with CC* Campuses and OSG Staff 

[CC* campuses](https://osg-htc.org/campus-cyberinfrastructure.html) (current and potential) will have the opportunity to build connections and to advance their technical know how at the dedicated CC* track. These sessions will bring together campus staff, including staff involved directly with HTC technology, with the OSG Consortium staff. The goal is to engage with and to learn from each other to improve the experience of providing or utilizing capacity and to advance scientific research on your own campus and across the nation.

### Speaking Opportunities 

We encourage you to consider giving a talk. Technical presentations at HTC25 are short, typically 20 minutes in length. Applying merely requires a brief abstract submission that can be submitted when registration opens.

### Visiting Madison

Madison, Wisconsin is both a beautiful and a popular place to visit in the summer. We will have room blocks reserved for HTC25 and encourage you to register and book your hotel room as early as possible. Further accommodation details will be availble when registration opens. 


### Questions and Resources

HTC25 is sponsored by the OSG Consortium, the HTCondor team and the UW-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing.
