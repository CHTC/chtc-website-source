We invite all admitted UW-Madison CS students for the MS/PhD program to join us for the Center for HIgh Throughput Computingâ€™s Open House. Students will have the opportunity to meet CHTC facilitators and learn about the computing services and capacity offered by CHTC.

CHTC staff will highlight how CHTC services and capacity can help researchers accomplish their research and computational goals. There will be time for Q+A from the CHTC Facilitation Team.

Last year serving UW-Madison with a team of facilitators providing research computing services, CHTC supported 312 projects, using over 34K HTC Core Years and 6K HPC Core Years. CHTC manages over 20,000 cores and dozens of GPUs for the UW-Madison campus; this resource is free and shared.
