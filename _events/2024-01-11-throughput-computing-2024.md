**Don't miss this opportunity to connect with the High Throughput Computing community.** 

You are invited to the second annual Throughput Computing event (HTC 24) from July 8-12 to be held in beautiful Madison, Wisconsin. HTC 24 brings together researchers, campuses, science collaborations, facilitators, administrators, government representatives, and professionals interested in high throughput computing to:

- Engage with the throughput computing community, including the [OSG Consortium](https://osg-htc.org/) and the [PATh](https://path-cc.io/) and [Pelican](https://pelicanplatform.org/) teams and many others contributing to HTC
- Be inspired by presentations and conversations with community leaders and contributors sharing common interests
- Learn about HTC and new developments to advance your science, your collaboration or your campus

**[Registration is Open!](https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2175/)**

### Connect with CC* Campuses and OSG Staff 

[CC* campuses](https://osg-htc.org/campus-cyberinfrastructure.html) (current and potential) will have the opportunity to build connections and to advance their technical know how at the dedicated CC* track held Wednesday, July 10th. These sessions will bring together campus staff, including staff involved directly with HTC technology, with the OSG Consortium staff. The goal is to engage with and to learn from each other to improve the experience of providing or utilizing capacity and to advance scientific research on your own campus and across the nation.

### Speaking Opportunities 

We are introducing Lightning Showcases from the community on Tuesday, July 9.  Come and give a lightning talk about your project, tool, or activities around HTC.  To keep the session relaxed and informal, there will be opportunities for signing up for a slot on the first day of the workshop.

We also encourage you to consider a more formal talk. Technical presentations at HTC 24 are short, typically 20 minutes in length. Applying merely requires a [brief abstract submission](https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2175/abstracts/). 

### Visiting Madison

Madison, Wisconsin is both a beautiful and a popular place to visit in the summer. We do have a limited number of room blocks reserved for HTC 24 and encourage you to register and book your hotel room as early as possible. Visit the Event Site [Local Arrangements](https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2175/page/67-local-arrangements) for accommodation details.
