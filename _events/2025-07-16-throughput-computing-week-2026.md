**Don't miss this opportunity to connect with the High Throughput Computing community.**

You are invited to the annual Throughput Computing Week (HTC26) from June 9-12 to be held in beautiful Madison, Wisconsin. HTC26 brings together researchers, campuses, science collaborations, facilitators, administrators, government representatives, and professionals interested in high-throughput computing to:

- Engage with the throughput computing community, including the [OSG Consortium](https://osg-htc.org/), [PATh](https://path-cc.io/) and [Pelican](https://pelicanplatform.org/) teams and many others contributing to HTC
- Be inspired by presentations and conversations with community leaders and contributors sharing common interests
- Learn about HTC and new developments to advance your science, your collaboration, or your campus

At HTC25, we had over 130 in-person attendees, and more than 80 presentations given by our volunteer speakers.

The event website will be launched in January, so stay tuned for more details.

### Connect with CC* Campuses and OSG Staff

[CC* campuses](https://osg-htc.org/campus-cyberinfrastructure.html) (current and potential) will have the opportunity to build connections and to advance their technical know-how at the dedicated CC* track. These sessions will bring together campus staff, including staff involved directly with HTC technology, with the OSG Consortium staff. The goal is to engage with and to learn from each other to improve the experience of providing or utilizing capacity and to advance scientific research on your own campus and across the nation.

### Speaking Opportunities

We encourage you to consider giving a talk. Technical presentations at HTC26 are short, typically 20 minutes in length. Applying merely requires a brief abstract submission. A link to submit these will go live alongside the event site early next year.

### Visiting Madison

Madison, Wisconsin is both a beautiful and a popular place to visit in the summer. We have room blocks reserved for HTC26 and encourage you to register and book your hotel room as early as possible. 


### Questions and Resources

HTC26 is sponsored by the OSG Consortium, the HTCondor team and the UW-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing.

For questions about attending, speaking, accommodations, and other concerns please contact us at [htc@path-cc.io](mailto:htc@path-cc.io).
