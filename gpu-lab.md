The CHTC GPU Lab is a [UW2020-funded project][uw2020] that will expand shared GPU 
computing infrastructure at UW-Madison.  It will include:

* a pool of shared GPU servers managed by CHTC 
* a community of technical experts
* a library of sharable software and documentation

To get started with GPU computing in CHTC, visit the [GPU jobs guide][gpu-jobs] 
and see the [runnable examples on GitHub][gpu-examples].

For more information about the CHTC GPU Lab contact [Anthony Gitter][gitter]. Email 
[chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu) for general CHTC GPU computing 
questions.  Subscribe to the CHTC GPU Lab WiscList 
by emailing [join-chtc-gpu-lab@lists.wisc.edu](mailto:join-chtc-gpu-lab@lists.wisc.edu) to receive updates.

UW2020 is funded by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate 
Education and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.
