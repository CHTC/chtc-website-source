If advancing the state of the art of distributed computing in an
academic environment interests you, the Center for High Throughput
Computing (CHTC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) offers a
unique working environment. Our project's home is in the UW Department
of Computer Sciences, an internationally recognized department
consistently ranked in the top ten across the USA. A position with CHTC
will provide you the opportunity to interact with both department
faculty and students to translate novel ideas into real-world solutions.
The software and infrastructure you will be working on is used by
scientists and engineers at hundreds of institutions, from universities
to national laboratories and from large high tech corporations to small
animation teams.

The CHTC is home to a large distributed campus infrastructure that helps
scientists on and off campus advance their research. We also develop the
[HTCondor Software](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) for managing
large-scale distributed computing, which we refer to as high-throughput
distributed computing. HTCondor powers the CHTC and is used by
scientists and businesses around the world. We are involved in many
collaborations, including (but not limited to) [The Open Science
Grid](http://www.opensciencegrid.org/).
