title: The Center for High Throughput Computing
---

<P>
The Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) offers computing resources for use by researchers.
Approved in August 2006, the CHTC provides the numerous resources at its disposal to keep up with the
computational needs of UW-Madison. These resources are funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH),
the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and various grants from the University itself.  
<p class="bigpara">
These resources are provided to <em>all</em> UW-Madison researchers, <em>free of charge</em>.
Even external collaborators with an on-campus sponsor may be given access to resources.

<a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/htc.html">High throughput computing (HTC)</a>
is the shared utilization of autonomous resources toward a common goal,
where all the elements are optimized for maximizing computational 
throughput 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_computing">Wikipedia entry</a>).

The CHTC facilitates access to an ever-growing set of resources. The UW campus computing grid is comprised of pools of
machines approaching a total of 10,000 cores. From July 2011 to June 2012, the CHTC provided <strong>70 Million CPU hours</strong>
to campus researchers and off-campus collaborators. Learn more in our

<strong>The CHTC is home to or supports the following projects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/">HTCondor project</a> 
provides the globally-used HTCondor software that powers the CHTC. HTCondor enables the CHTC to
maximize job throughput for many simultaneous users, each with different needs. It supports
complex workflows, the ability to take checkpoints and then resume jobs, and it enables access
to additional computing resources across the globe.
</li>
<li> The <a href="http://www.batlab.org/">UW Build and Test Lab</a>
 (BaTLab) is a multi-platform facility that promotes continuous building 
and testing of software. HTCondor is built in the BaTLab, and the BaTLab helps us work toward our goal
of deploying error-free, high quality software for the CHTC. The BaTLab is available to the general
public.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org">Open Science Grid</a> 
(OSG) is a high-throughput computing infrastructure that supports science. 
It is an expanding alliance of more than 80 universities, national laboratories, 
scientific collaborations, and software developers. 
CHTC users can access OSG's considerable computing and storage resources.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.neos-server.org">NEOS Online Optimization Service</a> 
is a high-throughput computing infrastructure that provides solvers for a variety of
optimization problems. It also provides a background on the field of optimization
in general and includes several case studies that provide beginners with an understanding
of optimization problems and approaches to solving them. NEOS is available to the general
public.
