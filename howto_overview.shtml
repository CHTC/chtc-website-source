title: CHTC Tools for R and Python Portability
---

<p>
Software like Matlab, R, and Python may or may not exist on CHTC-accessible
 compute hardware (especially on the UW Grid and Open Science Grid). Even if
 it is installed, it may not be the version you need. So, in order to get
 your jobs running on as many computers as possible, we are happy to work with
 you to create scripts that will bring  along your R, Matlab, or Python dependencies (like libraries and modules).

<blockquote>
These guides will be replaced by a new, updated process on <b>Monday, October 21</b>. If you're 
starting a new project, we recommend using the updated process instead of the guides below. See
<a href="/howto_overview_new.shtml">this page</a> for the new guides.
