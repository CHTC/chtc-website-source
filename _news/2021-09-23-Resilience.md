In the face of the pandemic, scientists needed to adapt. 
The article below by the [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org/) provides a thoughtful look into how researchers have pivoted in these challenging times to come together and contribute meaningfully in the global fight against COVID-19. 
One of these pivots occurred in the spring of 2020, when Morgridge and the CHTC issued a call for projects investigating COVID-19, resulting in five major collaborations that leveraged the power of HTC.

For a closer look into how the CHTC and researchers have learned, grown, and adapted during the pandemic, read the full Morgridge article:
