<p>Research is a computationally expensive endeavor, demanding on any computing resources available.  Quite often, a researcher will require resources for computations for short bursts of time, frequently leaving the computer idle.  This often results in wasted potential computation time.  This issue can be addressed by means of high-throughput computing.</p>
<p>High-throughput computing allows for many computational tasks to be done over a long period of time.  It is concerned largely with the number of compute resources that are available to people who wish to use the system.  It is a very useful system for researchers, who are more concerned with the number of computations they can do over long spans of time than they are with short-burst computations.  Because of its value to research computations, the Univeristy of Wisconsin set up the Center for High-Throughput Computing to bring researchers and compute resources together.</p>
<p>The Center for High-Throughput Computing (CHTC), approved in August 2006, has numerous resources at its disposal to keep up with the computational needs of UW Madison.  These resources are being funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and various grants from the University itself.  Email us to see what we can do to help automate your research project at <a href="mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu">chtc@cs.wisc.edu</a> It aims to pull four different resources together into one operation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>HTC Technologies:</b> The CHTC leans heavily on the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">HTCondor project</a> to provide a framework where high-throughput computing can take place.  The HTCondor project aims to make grid and high-throughput computing a reality in any number of environments.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Dedicated Resources: CHTC HTCondor pool</b>
	The CHTC cluster is now composed of 1900 cores for use by researches across our campus. These rack mounted blade systems run Linux. Each core is 2.8Ghz with 1.5GB RAM or better. CHTC has provided 10 million CPU hours of research computation between 05/17/2008 and 02/23/2010 prior to the additional 960 cores. With the recent server purchase, CHTC provides in excess of 37,000 CPU hours per day.

	</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><b>Middleware:</b> The GRIDS branch at UW Madison will be an essential part towards keeping the CHTC running efficiently.  GRIDS is funded by the NSF Middleware Initiative (NMI).  At the University of Wisconsin, the HTCondor project makes heavy use of this system with their <a href="http://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/">NMI Build &amp; Test facility</a>.  The NMI Build &amp; Test facility provides a framework to build and test software on a wide variety of platform and hardware combinations.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Computing Laboratory:</b> The University of Wisconsin has many compute clusters at its disposal.  In 2004 the university won an award to build the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/glow/">Grid Laboratory of Wisconsin</a> (GLOW).  GLOW is an interdepartmental pool of HTCondor nodes, containing 3000 CPUs and about 1 PB of storage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) campus is an excellent match for meeting the computational needs of your project. Existing UW technology infrastructure that can be leveraged includes CPU capacity, network connectivity, storage availability, and middleware connectivity. But perhaps most important, the UW has significant staff experience and core competency in deploying, managing, and using computational technology. 
</p>
<p>
<b>To reiterate:</b> The UW launched and funded the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC), a campus-wide organization dedicated to supercharging research on campus by working side-by-side with you, the domain scientists on infusing high throughput computing and grid computing techniques into your routine. Between the CHTC and the aforementioned HTCondor Project, the UW is home to over 20 full-time staff with a proven track record of making compute middleware work for scientists. Far beyond just being familiar with deployment and use of such software, UW staff has been intimately involved in its design and implementation.

<p>
<b>Applications:</b>  Many researchers are already using these facilities.  More information about a sampling of those using the CHTC can be found <a href="projects">here</a>.
