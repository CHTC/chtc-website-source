<p class="p2"><b>Researcher</b></p>
<p class="p3">Research Computing Facilitator PVL #75816</p>
<p class="p4">Candidate will demonstrate an appreciation for a wide range of compute and data intensive research and be experienced in at least one research area such as life science, computational science, physical science or social science. Candidate must understand how high performance and high throughput computing technologies are used to enable scientific discovery. Candidate must have at least one year of experience running an MPI-based science application in a high performance cluster using a PBS, SLURM or similar scheduler. Understanding user requirements and translating those requirements into functional and dependable solutions, working with scientific programming languages like Matlab or R and troubleshooting skills are required. Basic programming skills using scripting languages like Unix shell, Python or Perl, is also required. Ideal candidates will demonstrate experience applying advanced software tools and computing technologies in a dynamic and diverse research setting. Experience with national scientific computing initiatives such as the Open Science Grid or XSEDE will be a plus.</p>
<p class="p3">Principal Duties:</p>
<p class="p5">60% - Help campus researchers leverage state of the art distributed high throughput and high performance computing capabilities to accelerate their data acquisition and analysis. Work with researchers to understand their workflows and facilitate running their stand-alone applications on CHTC and on other national scientific computing resources.</p>
<p class="p5">30% - Create documents that describe given research problems and propose how to apply computing technics to address those problems. Document case management activities and help transfer documented solutions to research groups on campus for future project applications.</p>
<p class="p5">10% - Identify ways that our existing research computing middleware and infrastructure can enable or automate scientific discovery and work with the infrastructure and software development teams to address gaps where existing middleware/infrastructure is insufficient.</p>
