                The CHTC offers a suite of open-source software tools that manage HTC
                workloads and enable organizations to form distributed HTC pools.

                        The
                        HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) is the product of over three decades of
                        research and development at the Computer Sciences Department of the
                        University of Wisconsin-Madison. It has been adopted by academic and
                        commercial entities around the world in support of their HTC workloads.

                        Whether your idea of large scale computing is your desktop or a planet-wide pool of resources, HTCSS provides the technologies for managing workloads and all your computing resources.  HTCSS consists of four main components: the Access Point (AP), the Central Manager (CM), the Execution Point (EP), and the Compute Element (CE).

                        The main goal of the Event Workflow Management Service (EWMS) project is to advance the state of task scheduling and management by combining the handling of small, discrete events with the computing scale of modern scientific collaborations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        EWMS is a workflow management system built on HTCondor designed to process billions of fine grained events. It optimizes scheduling to fit work units into smaller resource envelopes and pipelines data transfer.

                    <p>
                        BirdBath was HTCondor's entry into the world of Web Services. Its goal was to augment some of the core HTCondor daemons with Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interfaces so that they can be queried and controlled through programs other than the standard HTCondor command-line tools. The main interfaces are currently to the Schedd for submitting and querying jobs, and the Collector for accessing information about a HTCondor pool.

                    <p>
                        BOSCO is a job submission manager designed to help researchers manage large numbers (~1000s) of job submissions to the different resources that they can access on a campus (initially a PBS cluster running Linux).

                    <p>
                        Checkpointing was developed to continue a vacated job without a complete loss of computation time. HTCondor does this by using a checkpoint of a jobâ€™s state. A checkpoint is generated just before a job vacates a machine. The checkpoint is then used as a starting point for the job after migration.

                    <p>
                        Chirp is a lightweight I/O protocol and filesystem for grid computing. It consists of familiar operations such as open(), read(), write(), and close(). In addition, Chirp provides a variety of authentication methods, allowing remote users to identify themselves with strong Globus or Kerberos credentials.

                        Classified Advertisements (classads) are the lingua franca of HTCondor. They are used for describing jobs, workstations, and other resources. They are exchanged by HTCondor processes to schedule jobs. They are logged to files for statistical and debugging purposes. They are used to enquire about current state of the system.

                        DAGMan (Directed Acyclic Graph Manager) is a meta-scheduler for HTCondor. It manages dependencies between jobs at a higher level than the HTCondor Scheduler.

                    <p>
                        The object of the Grid ASCII Helper Protocol (GAHP) is to allow the use of the client library or package of a grid or cloud service via a simple ASCII-based protocol. A process which implements GAHP is referred to as a GAHP server. GAHP is designed to handle both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) calls.
