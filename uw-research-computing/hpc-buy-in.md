title: HPC Cluster Buy In Options 
---

The [Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC)]({{site.baseurl | append : '/' }}) offers a buy-in
option for the campus-shared [high performance computing (HPC)
Cluster](HPC-overview), which otherwise includes a large, freely available
set of capacity initially funded with support from the [Advanced Computing
Initiative (ACI)](http://aci.wisc.edu/).

**Please contact <chtc@cs.wisc.edu>, if you would like to discuss
purchase options (especially if for a significant number of servers),
perhaps including hardware to be added to CHTC\'s HTC System.**

Purchases of a chassis of four homogeneous servers (each server with 128
GB RAM and 20 cores of 2.5 GHz) costs \~\$23,000 and includes a minimum
of 3 years of support with priority access on a dedicated queue
partition with many other support and hardware hosting benefits,
including:

-   continued access to the freely-available cluster partitions
-   fast Infiniband networking (56 Gbit/s) and the SLURM queueing system
-   use of the cluster\'s scratch-based filesystem with a starting
    value of 100 GB of storage space, per user, and options for space
    increases
-   server hosting: server room space, rack costs, power and cooling
    costs
-   cluster administration and human support through the CHTC (Systems
    Administrators and Research Computing Facilitators)
-   free access to commonly-used software covered by campus licenses and
    the CHTC
-   multi-group, license-sharing options for research-specific software
-   resource sharing options for temporary, on-demand access to more
    cores
-   automatic hardware upgrades when deemed necessary for the cluster

All chassis purchases are considered capitol equipment. To learn more
about the buy-in option, please contact use (chtc@cs.wisc.edu). Typically, prior use of the HPC
Cluster and a consultation with CHTC staff are required for new purchases.
