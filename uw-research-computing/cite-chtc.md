The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) campus is an excellent
match for meeting the computational needs of this project. Existing
UW-Madison technology infrastructure supported by the CHTC can be
readily leveraged, including CPU capacity, network connectivity, storage
availability, and middleware connectivity. The UW-Madison has invested 
in the CHTC as the primary provider of shared, computing resources to 
campus researchers. All standard CHTC services are provided 
free-of-charge to UW-Madison researchers, their projects, and 
collaborators. But perhaps most important,
the UW-Madison has significant staff experience and core competency in
deploying, managing, and using computational technology.\
\
For high throughput computing (HTC) capability, UW-Madison supports 
more than a dozen compute clusters across campus, which are managed 
via the HTCondor software developed by the CHTC; therefore, these 
clusters are linked together to share resources via a widely adopted 
distributed computing technologies. CHTC\'s dedicated HTC cluster 
includes GPUs and individual servers with multiple TB of memory. For 
high performance computing (HPC) capability (large, tightly-coupled work), 
the CHTC also maintains a shared-use cluster of approximately 7,500 
tightly-coupled cores. The configuration of CHTC resources has also 
been informed by collaborations with fellow computing centers at other 
campuses through the NSF-funded ACI-REF and CaRCC projects.\
\
Together, CHTC-supported resources provided over 365 million CPU hours 
in 2020, and individual users regularly obtain in excess of 10,000 CPU 
hours per day. Temporary storage space for large files can support up 
to hundreds of terabytes of total working data. Should these resources 
not be sufficient for the project, the CHTC can also engage computing 
resources from across the campus grid and the [OS Pool](https://osg-htc.org/about/open_science_pool/), 
an NSF-supported and expanding alliance of more than 60 universities, 
national laboratories, scientific collaborations, and software developers. 
CHTC users frequently obtain in excess of 150,000 free CPU hours per day from OS Pool, 
with individual users achieving up to 100,000 CPU hours per day, across 
all of these.\
\
The CHTC is home to over 20 full-time staff with a proven track record 
of making compute middleware work for scientists. Far beyond just being 
familiar with the deployment and use of such software, UW staff has been 
intimately involved in its design and implementation.  Dedicated Research 
Computing Facilitators are available to provide training to all CHTC 
users and are available to consult on computational practices for 
achieving the best scientific throughput. As always, CHTC will be happy 
to provide consulting to ensure optimal use of its facilities, and 
development of robust, reproducible methods for scalable computing.\
