	The Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) supports a variety scalable computing
	resources and services for UW-affiliated researchers and their collaborators, including
	high-throughput computing (HTC) <i>and</i>, tightly-couple computations (e.g. message
	passing interface, or "MPI"), high-memory, and GPUs. CHTC compute systems and personnel are
	funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health,
	the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Morgridge Institute for Research,
	and various grants from the university.

<p>
	Standard access to CHTC resources are provided to <em>all</em> UW-Madison researchers, <em>free of charge</em>.
	Even external collaborators with an on-campus sponsor may be given access to resources. We also offer
	hardware buy-in options for priority access to computing capacity on a case-by-case basis, though
	standard access is more than sufficient for the vast majority of CHTC users.
