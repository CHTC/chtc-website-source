### There are multiple ways to get help from CHTC staff. See below:

## Research Computing Facilitators

To help researchers effectively utilize computing resources, our Research
Computing Facilitators (RCFs) not only assist your in
implementing your computational work on CHTC compute resources
resources, but can also point you to other on- and off-campus services
related to research computing and data needs. For example, RCFs can: 

* Assist with planning your computational approach for a research
problem 
* Teach you to submit jobs to CHTC compute systems 
* Help you with troubleshooting on CHTC compute systems 
* Connect you with other researchers using similar software or methods 
* Point to learning materials for programming and software development 
* Help you identify applicable non-CHTC data storage options provided by DoIT 
* Find the person who knows the answer to your question, even if the RCF doesn't 
* ... and other helpful activities to facilitate your use of cyberinfrastructure

## Get An Account

If you don't have an account yet, please fill out our [Request

questions, feel free to send an email to chtc@cs.wisc.edu (see below).

## Help Via Email

We provide support via email at the address
[chtc@cs.wisc.edu](Mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu), and it's never a bad idea
to start by sending questions or issues via email. You can typically
expect a first response within a few business hours.

## Office Hours

**Cancellations will be announced via email and on this webpage.**

<!--
> ## Office Hours are cancelled on Tuesday, August 24

In light of [measures being taken by campus regarding COVID-19](https://covid19.wisc.edu/), 
we have replaced in-person office hours with virtual office hours, office hours are:

-   **Tuesday/Thursday afternoons, from 3:00 - 4:45 pm.** 

To drop in, find the videoconference link in either your email (via 
an announcement to chtc-users sent on Wed., March 11) or in the login message
when you log into a CHTC server. 

As always, if the times above don't work for you, please email us 
at our usual support address to schedule a separate meeting.

<!-- For users who already have accounts, we have drop-in office hours on:

-   **Tuesday/Thursday afternoons, from 3:00 - 4:30 pm.**
-   **Wednesday morning from 9:30 - 11:30 am**

Office Hours are located in the [Discovery
Building](http://map.wisc.edu/s/919bjy8v) at the second-floor round
table, just off of the main staircase.\
 **For researchers without access to the upper floors of the Discovery
Building, check in at the front desk and ask them to "call CHTC."**\
 We will confirm that you are here for office hours and you will be let
upstairs. (Note: If you ask the desk to call for a facilitator, by name,
no one will answer as facilitators will not be in their *own* offices
during Office Hours.) --> 

## Make an Appointment

We are happy to arrange meetings outside of designated Office Hours, per
your preference. Simply email us at the address above, and we will set
up a time to meet!
