		<p>
		The HTCondor project provides the globally-used HTCondor software that powers the CHTC's <i>HTC resources</i>. HTCondor enables the CHTC to
		maximize job throughput for many simultaneous users, each with different needs. It supports
		complex workflows, the ability to take checkpoints and then resume jobs, and it enables access
		to additional computing resources across the globe, like the OS Pool.
