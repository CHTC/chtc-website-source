## CHTC Facilitator Holiday Availability; New Office Hour Times in 2022
### December 22, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

This is an annual reminder that CHTC staffing will be somewhat reduced during the next week. 

- Office Hours are cancelled next week (Dec. 27 - 31), and email responses will also be delayed during 
this period. *Office Hours are still on for tomorrow, Dec. 23.*
- Normal email response times will resume on Monday, January 3rd. 

**We will have a new office hours schedule in 2022.** Starting the week of January 3rd, office hours will be on: 

- Tuesdays: **10:30am - 12pm** (note the different time!)
- Thursdays: 3pm - 4:30pm

Please remember that your work on CHTC's shared compute systems can affect other users. You should review and 
continue to follow CHTC policies for our [HTC System](use-submit-node.html) and [HPC Cluster](hpc-overview.html) to ensure that you are 
acting in consideration of others, especially since CHTC staff may not be able to respond as quickly to user-caused issues.

As always, the best way to get in touch with us is through our designated email address (chtc@cs.wisc.edu). 

Best wishes during the holiday season!

Christina, Lauren, Rachel and the rest of the CHTC team
