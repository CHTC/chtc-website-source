## CHTC outages starting 5pm today (3/9)
### March 9, 2022

Greetings CHTC Users,
 
Due to short-notice maintenance for the cooling infrastructure in one of CHTCâ€™s server rooms, we will have an outage starting tonight (3/9) that will impact our HPC cluster and certain HTC execute nodes. 
 
HPC Cluster
* The HPC cluster, including execute nodes, head nodes, and filesystem, will be down starting at 6:00pm on Wednesday (3/9) with services expected to be restored by the end of the day on Thursday (3/10). 
* The HPC cluster is configured to not start new jobs that will not complete before the start of the scheduled downtime. Already-running jobs that do not complete by tonight will be interrupted and re-queued once systems are operational. Users may want to remove any jobs that will be negatively impacted by this process. 
 
HTC System
* Some HTC execute nodes, including some researcher-owned GPU nodes, will be down starting at 5:00pm on Wednesday (3/9) with services expected to be restored by the end of the day on Thursday (3/10). Jobs running on these nodes will be evicted and remain in the queue to be re-run. 
* We do not expect the HTC system submit servers, transfer server, or Staging filesystem to be impacted at this time. 
 
We appreciate your patience as the ongoing maintenance in this room has meant a lot of extra announcements to this list, and not always with our usual amount of notice.
 
As always, email us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions. 
 
Regards,
Your CHTC Team

## Minimal CHTC email support tomorrow (March 4)

Dear CHTC users, 

CHTC's Research Facilitation staff are spending dedicated time this Friday

Due to this effort, we will not be answering support requests on Friday. We 
will reply to emails received on Friday by Monday, March 7th. If you have 
questions or concerns, our support email (chtc@cs.wisc.edu) is still the best way to contact us. 

Best regards, 
Research Facilitation Team

### December 22, 2021

Greetings CHTC users, 

This is an annual reminder that CHTC staffing will be somewhat reduced during the next week. 

- Office Hours are cancelled next week (Dec. 27 - 31), and email responses will also be delayed during 
this period. *Office Hours are still on for tomorrow, Dec. 23.*
- Normal email response times will resume on Monday, January 3rd. 

**We will have a new office hours schedule in 2022.** Starting the week of January 3rd, office hours will be on: 

- Tuesdays: **10:30am - 12pm** (note the different time!)
- Thursdays: 3pm - 4:30pm

Please remember that your work on CHTC's shared compute systems can affect other users. You should review and 
continue to follow CHTC policies for our [HTC System](use-submit-node.html) and [HPC Cluster](hpc-overview.html) to ensure that you are 
acting in consideration of others, especially since CHTC staff may not be able to respond as quickly to user-caused issues.

As always, the best way to get in touch with us is through our designated email address (chtc@cs.wisc.edu). 

Best wishes during the holiday season!

Christina, Lauren, Rachel and the rest of the CHTC team
