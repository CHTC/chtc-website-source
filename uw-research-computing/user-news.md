## Full HPC and Partial HTC Outages Nov 18 - Nov 22
### November 10, 2021
Greetings,
 
Due to just-confirmed maintenance for the cooling infrastructure in one of CHTC’s server rooms, we will experience full HPC Cluster and partial HTC System outages beginning in the afternoon on Thursday, November 18, with service being restored by Monday, November 22.
 
 
**Impacts to the HPC Cluster**

All hardware (head nodes, execute nodes, storage) in the HPC cluster will be powered down during the planned outage.

To prevent HPC Cluster jobs from being interrupted by the downtime, we will begin draining the nodes one week prior to the downtime. **Jobs submitted requesting time that would exceed the November 18 downtime** will not run until after the cluster is back up, but will be accepted into the queue. Jobs can still run on the cluster within the week before the downtime, IF their time request (“--time=” in the submit file) indicates that they will complete before the morning of November 18.
 
 
**Impacts to the HTC System**

The following components of the HTC system will be powered down during the outage: 
* a subset of HTC execute nodes
* the following submit servers may go down (and would likely be inaccessible for through Nov 22), but we hope to keep them up: submit2.chtc.wisc.edu, submit3.chtc.wisc.edu, learn.chtc.wisc.edu

While jobs on the affected submit servers and execute servers will be interrupted when they go down, they will remain in the queue to run again once the submit servers are back up. Otherwise, HTC users should not be impacted by this outage. 
 
It is possible the exact dates of the outage may shift, and we realize this is somewhat short notice, but plan to provide a reminder or update at least one day prior to the start of the downtime.
 
Please contact us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions or concerns. 
 
Best, 
Your CHTC team

## Network upgrades Oct 6 - No downtime expected
### Monday, October 4, 2021

Greetings CHTC users!

An upgrade of the Discovery server room network will be performed during business hours this Wednesday, October 6, while CHTC services continue to operate. We expect that this maintenance will NOT affect CHTC systems or require any downtime, but will notify users ASAP if there are any unforeseen issues. Systems in this datacenter include the HPC Cluster (least likely to be affected), some HTC submit servers, and a portion of the HTC execute nodes (where jobs run).

As usual, please contact us with any questions or issues you notice by emailing chtc@cs.wisc.edu

Thank you,
Your CHTC Team

## HPC maintenance complete; no office hours on Tues, Aug 24
### Wednesday, August 18

Greetings CHTC users, 

Due to facilitator vacation schedules, we will be canceling office hours on Tuesday, August 24 next week. 

For users of our high performance computing (HPC) cluster: yesterday’s maintenance is now complete and log in access has been enabled through hpclogin1.chtc.wisc.edu. The second login node (hpclogin2.chtc.wisc.edu) is still being monitored and will be available for log in by the end of the week. 

Contact us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions or observed issues. 

Best, 

Your CHTC team

## HPC Cluster Maintenance Aug 17
### Wednesday, August 4

Greetings CHTC users,

This message is for users of our HPC Cluster. Users of only the HTC System can ignore.

The HPC Cluster will be taken down after 9am on August 17 for some regular maintenance and to address issues remaining after the partial campus power outage at the end of June. We expect the downtime to potentially last through the end of the business day. We will notify users if more time is necessary.

Potential impact to users:

- So that jobs are not interrupted by the downtime, jobs submitted after Aug 10 will only run if requesting less time than remaining prior to the start of the downtime.

- The contents of user directories in /scratch/local on login nodes will be wiped during the downtime, so users should make sure (as usual) that they have not left files in that location.

Email us at chtc@cs.wisc.edu with any questions or issues.

Regards,

Your CHTC Team

Please continue to write to chtc@cs.wisc.ed with any questions or issues, and know that we’ll reply to you as soon as we can. We plan to resume Office Hours on Tuesday, August 10.

Thank you,
