If you haven't already, create a DockerHub account and install 
Docker on your computer. You'll want to look for the [Docker Community
Edition](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
for your operating system. It sometimes takes some time for Docker to
start, especially the first time. Once Docker starts, it won't open a 
window; you'll just see a little whale and container icon in one of your 
computers toolbars. In order to actually use Docker, you'll need to 
open a command line program (like Terminal, or Command Prompt) and run 
commands there.
