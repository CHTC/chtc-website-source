### Using Markdown

You will be using Markdown to write all news articles. Markdown is a popular markup 
language that is converted to HTML before being displayed on the website.

A good cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) with some
things you can do with markdown.

### Using Images

High definition images can take up space that slows down the website when it loads, because of this it is important to reduce this footprint before adding them to the website.

To keep the image size reasonable follow the rules below.

- < 1000 pixels wide
    - This is the maximum website width, anything wider will not be beneficial.
- Convert to jpg and reduce to reasonable size
    - This is up to you and changes picture to picture. Some pictures look fine when compressed, some don't.
    - Good target is 200kb
