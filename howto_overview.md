title: CHTC Tools for R and Python Portability
---

Software like Matlab, R, and Python may or may not exist on
CHTC-accessible compute hardware (especially on the UW Grid and Open
Science Grid). Even if it is installed, it may not be the version you
need. So, in order to get your jobs running on as many computers as
possible, we are happy to work with you to create scripts that will
bring along your R, Matlab, or Python dependencies (like libraries and
modules).

> These guides will be replaced by a new, updated process on **Monday,
> October 21**. If you\'re starting a new project, we recommend using
> the updated process instead of the guides below. See [this
> page](/howto_overview_new.shtml) for the new guides.
