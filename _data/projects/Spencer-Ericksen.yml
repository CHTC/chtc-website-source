  I have been working on computational methods for predicting biomolecular recognition processes. The motivation is to develop reliable models for predicting binding interactions between drug-like small molecules and therapeutic target proteins. Our team at SMSF works with campus investigators on early-stage academic drug discovery projects. Computational models for virtual screening could prioritize candidate molecules for faster, cheaper focused screens on just tens of compounds. To perform a virtual screen, the models evaluate millions to billions of molecules, a computationally daunting task. But CHTC facilitators have been with us through every obstacle, helping us to effectively scale through parallelization over HTC nodes, matching appropriate resources to specific modeling tasks, compiling software, and using Docker containers. Moreover, CHTC provides access to vast and diverse compute resources.
