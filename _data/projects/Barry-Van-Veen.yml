  The bio-signal processing laboratory develops statistical signal processing
  methods for biomedical problems.  We use CHTC for casual network modeling of
  brain electrical activity.  We develop methods for identifying network models
  from noninvasive measures of electric/ magnetic fields at the scalp, or
  invasive measures of the electric fields at or in the cortex, such as electrocorticography.
  Model identification involves high throughput computing applied to large datasets
  consisting of hundreds of spatial channels each containing thousands of time samples.
