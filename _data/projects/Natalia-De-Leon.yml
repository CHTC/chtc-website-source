  Ethanol per acre is determined by the amount of biomass per acre and the quality of
  that biomass. Quality includes the concentration of fermentable sugars, the availability
  of those sugars for fermentation, and the concentration of inhibitors to the fermentation
  process. We are using maize (Zea mays L.) as a model grass to identify genes and pathways
  underlying these traits. Maize is an excellent model both because it is a potential
  source of biomass for the lignocellulosic ethanol industry, and also because it is closely
  related to other important dedicated-bioenergy species including Miscanthus (Miscanthus
  giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Our approach is to genetically dissect
  endogenous variation for biomass quantity and quality in maize, utilizing genetic mapping,
  association analysis and transcriptional profiling to identify genes and alleles that
  underlie phenotypic variation among maize genotypes. This forward genetic analysis
  provides an entry point into genes and pathways that could be further studied and
  manipulated to maximize ethanol production. For that end, we utilize cutting-edge genomic
  technologies, such as novel high throughput approaches to sequencing and genome-wide
  expression profiling technologies, as well as advanced computational procedures which
  utilize genomic information to understand the molecular basis of quantitative variation.
