  Professor <strong>Phil Townsend</strong> of Forestry and Wildlife Ecology says
  Our research (NASA & USDA Forest Service funded) strives to understand the outbreak
  dynamic of major forest insect pests in North America through simulation modeling.
  As part of this effort, we map forest species and their abundance using multi-temporal
  Landsat satellite data. My colleagues have written an automatic variable selection
  routine in MATLAB to preselect the most important image variables to model and map
  forest species abundance. However, depending on the number of records and the initial
  variables, this process can take weeks to run.  Hence, we seek resources to speed up
  this process.
