  The abstract from the first paper which is based on this research is
  "Critical Properties of the Kitaev-Heisenberg Model", Craig C. Price
  and Natalia B. Perkins, Phys. Rev. Lett. 190, 187201.
  We study the critical properties of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the
  honeycomb lattice at finite temperatures that might describe the physics
  of the quasi-two-dimensional compounds, Na2IrO3 and Li2IrO3.  The model
  undergoes two phase transitions as a function of temperature.  At low
  temperature, thermal fluctuations induce magnetic long-range order by
  the order-by-disorder mechanism.  This magnetically ordered state with
  a spontaneously broken Z6 symmetry persists up to a certain critical temperature.
  We find that there is an intermediate phase between the low-temperature,
  ordered phase and the high-temperature, disordered phase.  Finite-sized scaling
  analysis suggests that the intermediate phase is a critical Kosterlitz-Thouless
  phase with continuously variable exponents.
  We argue that the intermediate phase has been observed above the low-temperature,
  magnetically ordered phase in Na2IrO3, and also, likely exists in Li2IrO3.
