  The Hazy Research Group of the department of Computer Sciences is led by <strong>Christopher M. Re</strong>,
  with interests in large-scale, and deep data analytics. A machine reading system is a large software
  system that extracts information and knowledge buried in raw data such as text, tables, figures,
  and scanned documents.  For example, it can extract
  facts like "Barack Obama wins the 2012 election" from news articles, or "Barnett Formation contains 6%
  Carbon" from geology journal articles.  To extract this kind of information, a machine reading system
  requires deep understanding and statistical analytics over large document corpora.  In the Hazy Research
  Group, we are building a machine reading system that supports scientific applications like
  <a href="http://hazy.cs.wisc.edu/hazy/geo">GeoDeepDive</a>, and many other projects.  Please visit our
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/HazyResearch">YouTube Channel</a> for video overviews of our projects.
  We leverage the resources of the CHTC, and the national Open Science Grid to enable our machine reading
  system to quickly perform a whole host of computationally expensive tasks like statistical linguistic
  processing, speech-to-text transcription, and optical character recognition (OCR).  For example, on a crawl of
  500 million web pages, we estimated that our deep linguistic parsing would take more than 5 years on a single
  machine.  With the help of CHTC, we were able to do it in just 1 week!  Similarly, on a recent batch of
  30,000 geology journal articles, we estimated that the OCR task would take 34 years on a single machine.
  With CHTC, it took about 2 weeks.  Thanks CHTC!
