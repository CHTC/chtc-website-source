  IceCube has transformed a cubic kilometer of natural Antarctic ice into a neutrino detector.  We have discovered a flux of high-energy neutrinos of cosmic origin, with an energy flux that is comparable to that of high-energy photons. We have also identified its first source: on September 22, 2017, following an alert initiated by a 290-TeV neutrino, observations by other astronomical telescopes pinpointed a flaring active galaxy, powered by a supermassive black hole. We study the neutrinos themselves, some with energies exceeding by one million those  produced by accelerators. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is managed and operated by the Wisconsin IceCube Astroparticle Physics Center (WIPAC) in the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Graduate Education and Research and funded by a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. We have used CHTC and the Open Science Pool for over a decade to perform all large-scale data analysis tasks and generate Monte Carlo simulations of the instrument's performance. Without CHTC and OSP resources we would simply be unable to make any of IceCube's groundbreaking discoveries. Francis Halzen is the Principal Investigator of IceCube. See the
