  We use CHTC machines to carry out molecular dynamics simulations to study
  chemical reactions in solution and biomolecules.  By using a semi-empirical
  QM/MM methods developed in our group, these calculations can run efficiently
  in a largely uncoupled fashion with the CHTC system.  This type of computing
  environment is ideal for many studies that require running a large number of
  independent computations, such as constructing the free energy landscape of
  chemical reactions in the condensed phase.
