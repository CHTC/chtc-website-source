  In our research we're working on a novel computational tool for THz-frequency
  characterization of materials with high carrier densities, such as highly-doped
  semiconductors and metals. The numerical technique tracks carrier-field dynamics by
  combining the ensemble Monte Carlo simulator of carrier dynamics with the finite-difference
  time-domain technique for Maxwell's equations and the molecular dynamics technique for
  close-range Coulomb interactions. This technique is computationally intensive and each test
  runs long enough (12-20 hours) that our group's cluster isn't enough. This is why we think
  CHTC can help, to let us run more jobs than we're able to run now.
