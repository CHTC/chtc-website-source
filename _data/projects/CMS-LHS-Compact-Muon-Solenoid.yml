description: The UW team participating in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
  experiment analyzes petabytes of data from proton-proton collisions in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  We use
  the unprecedented energies of the LHC to study Higgs Boson signatures, Electroweak Physics, and the possibility
  of exotic particles beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  Important calculations are also performed to
  better tune the experiment's trigger system, which is responsible for making nanosecond-scale decisions about
  which collisions in the LHC should be recorded for further analysis.
