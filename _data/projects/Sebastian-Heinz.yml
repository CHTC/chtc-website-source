  We are working on investigating the impact that astrophysical jets have on the
  intergalactic medium (IGM) in galaxy clusters. These jets, eminating from supermassive
  black holes at the centers of galaxies, can significantly impact the IGM, which in turn
  impacts galaxy evolution. Computer simulations permit us to test various scenarios like
  determining how to heat the IGM.
