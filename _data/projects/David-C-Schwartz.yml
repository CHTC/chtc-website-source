  David uses the CHTC to comprehensively analyze human and cancer genomes. CHTC
  provices enough throughput for this project to map data representing the
  equivalent of one human genome in 90 minutes. See the
  <a href="http://www.lmcg.wisc.edu/">LMCG (Laboratory for molecular and Computational Genomics) web site</a>
  for project details.
