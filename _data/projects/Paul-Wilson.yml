Paul Wilson, head of The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG), the Grainger Professor for Nuclear Engineering, and the current chair of the Department of Engineering Physics.  
CNERGâ€™s mission is to foster the development of new generations of nuclear engineers and scientists through the development and deployment of open and reliable software tools for the analysis of complex nuclear energy systems. Our inspiration and motivation come from performing those analyses on large, complex systems. Such simulations require ever-increasing computational resources and CHTC has been our primary home for both HPC and HTC computation for nearly a decade. In addition to producing our results faster and without the burden of administering our computer hardware, we rely on CHTC resources to demonstrate performance improvements that arise from our methods development. The role-defining team of research computing facilitators has ensured a smooth onboarding of each of them and helped them find the resources they need to be most effective.
