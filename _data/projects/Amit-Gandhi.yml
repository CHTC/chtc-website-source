  I use CHTC to do structural estimation of economic models.  These problems boil down to
  finding a value in a parameter space that best satisfies some objective criterion that is
  derived from economic theory and is a function of the data.  The difficulty is that the
  criterion is typically a complicated non-linear function of the parameter that requires
  some intensive computations for each observation in the data.  For problems with lots of
  data, this can become unwieldy!  Rather than work with an MPI model for distributed computing,
  I have found that exploring the landscape of the objective function with the high throughput
  CHTC approach allows me to much more quickly gain an understanding of the likely parameter values.
  This greatly facilitates the econometric estimation of problems that otherwise would not be feasible.
