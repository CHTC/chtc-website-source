  Shanan’s primary research thrust involves quantifying the spatial and temporal distribution of rocks in the Earth’s crust in order to constrain the long-term evolution of life and Earth’s surface environment. Compiling data from scientific publications is a key component of this work and Peters and his collaborators are developing machine reading systems deployed over the xDD digital library ad cyberinfrastructure hosted in the CHTC for this purpose.
