  The Research Software Engineer (RSE) will work to bring modern software engineering techniques and approaches
  to research projects at the institute as part of long-running engagements and collaborations between scientists.
  
  At Morgridge, the RSE will sit at the nexus of exciting research, large-scale computing, and national
  cyberinfrastructure projects. Whether its bringing a codebase up to production quality, designing
  programmatic interfaces, or making workloads run more effectively across thousands of cores, the
  RSE will have a diversity of challenges and help advance Morgridgeâ€™s goals of Fearless Science. 
  
  Potential projects will be diverse, including computational Cryo-EM, storage management for distributed
  computing, natural language processing, and single-cell RNAseq; projects can be tailored based on the candidate.
