title: Database techniques and data architecture
scale: Medium
type: Software Development
summary: |
  The HTCondor scheduler stores historical information about completed and 
  removed jobs in a single, flat, sequential file on disk with little indexing.
  As such, querying this file for information about a single job is very slow.
  This project will add an index, perhaps with an off-the-shelf open source 
  database or on-disk hashing tool to provide quick access to single entries 
  in the history, and use this index in the python based cli tool. Students 
  completing this project will gain real world experience in database
  techniques and Python programming.
