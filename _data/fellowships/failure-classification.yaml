title: ML for failure classification in the OSPool
scale: Large
type: Software Development
summary: |
  The OSPool runs hundreds of thousands of jobs every day on dozens of 
  different sites, each unique in their own way.  Naturally, there are 
  many hundreds of failures, most of which the system works around, but
  with added latency to workflow completion. This project would attempt
  to automatically classify failures from job logs to detect common 
  patterns and highlight places for humans to look to fix common failures
  with the most payoff. Students working on this project will gain
  experience applying ML techniques to real world problems.
