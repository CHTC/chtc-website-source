title: Benchmarking OSDF Performance via the OSPool
type: Software Development
summary: |
  The OSDF is the flagship instance of a Pelican data federation and most often used via the OSPool, a 
  HTCondor pool open to any US-based researcher or collaborators.  In this project, we aim to design a 
  test harness for benchmarking the OSDF and tools to analyze the performance of a test run.
  
  The project would create a toolkit that submits workflows for testing the OSDF across multiple sites; 
  we aim to test as many combinations of origins, caches, and clusters as possible.  The same toolkit
  would then be used to analyze the logs of the run and create an HTML report of the performance and
  reliability of the OSDF.  The ultimate goal is to run the testing nightly, giving the OSDF administrators
  a morning snapshot of the federationâ€™s status.
