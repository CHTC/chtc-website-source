title: Classifying User Contributed Images
type: Facilitation
summary: |
  CHTCâ€™s High Throughput Computing (HTC) system supports hundreds of users and thousands of jobs each day. It is optimized for workloads or sets of jobs, where many jobs can run in parallel as computational capacity becomes available. This project aims to better understand the impact of workload size and requirements on overall throughput through empirical measurement of workloads in CHTC. A key component of the project will be developing tools to a) submit sample workloads and b) gather metrics about their performance. Once these tools are developed, they can be used to run experiments with different workload types.  
  
  #### Project Objectives:
    
    - Develop a synthetic workload generation tool that uses job parameters to automatically generate test HTC workloads.
    - Identify a list of 5-6 core metrics for measuring HTC workload performance in collaboration with the Facilitation team.
    - Develop a tool that extracts these core metrics using HTCondor log files or other command line tools.
    - Use the above tools end-to-end, to generate a test workload and measusre its outcomes

  #### Prerequisite skills or education that would be good for the Fellow to have to work on the project:
    
    - Familiarity with unix and Python
    - Familiarity with git
    -Familiarity with HTCondor]
