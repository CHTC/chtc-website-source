title: Synchronizing datasets via the OSDF
type: Software Development
scale: Large
summary: |
  The `pelican` client tool provides a standalone mechanism to upload and download single
  files from a data federation.  While the client works well, a typical use case is downloading
  an entire dataset - potentially, tens of thousands of files or hundreds of terabytes.
  When moving a dataset, features like state management and resumption become important.
  
  In this project, we will explore better ways to automate dataset movement to and from the 
  OSDF, exploring approaches like the [HTCondor file transfer tool](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-file-transfer). 
  The goal for the end of the summer would be to move a 100TB dataset using a single command.
