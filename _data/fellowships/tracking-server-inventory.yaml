title: Tracking server inventory and elevation
scale: Medium
type: Infrastructure Services
summary: |
  The CHTC maintains over 1,000 servers on the UWâ€“Madison campus and across the
  country. Keeping track of server elevation (datacenter and rack location), 
  serial numbers, asset tags is a challenge that is always in need of improvement.
  This project will focus on taking existing data from the CHTC hardware monitoring
  system and automatically exporting it to other systems such as Google spreadsheets
  or ITAdvisor. After a successful summer, the student fellow will gain skills
  in Python and monitoring and Google Docs APIs.
