title: Expanded Pelican origin monitoring
type: Software Development
summary: |
  The Pelican origin service is responsible for exporting objects in the backend storage to the data federation.
  As it is the “entry point” for the data, understanding the load on the origin and its activities is key to keeping
  the federation healthy.  Pelican takes monitoring data from the web server component and feeds it into the popular
  Prometheus software to store time series about the activity. This project would focus on:
  
  - Implementing new monitoring probes to complement the existing information.
  - Forwarding the raw, unsummarized data to an ElasticSearch database for further analysis.
  - Designing visualizations to provide administrators with an overview of the origin’s activities.
  - Implementing alerts when there are health issues with the origin.
  
  After a successful summer, the student fellow will gain skills in using the Go language, the Prometheus monitoring system (and other Cloud Native technologies), and web design.
