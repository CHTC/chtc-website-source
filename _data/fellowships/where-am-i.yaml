title: Where in the world am I?
scale: Large
type: Software Development
summary: |
  In PATh, an important part of the infrastructure is the “glidein”, a client that
  starts at a remote location and provides computational cycles for research.
  In the past, glideins have relied on configuration at remote locations to
  determine their location but this often results in missing or incorrect 
  information. This project will focus on enhancing glideins so that they
  can detect and report where they are running in the world, possibly including
  data like geolocation and institutional owner. After a successful summer,
  the student fellow will gain skills in Python, bash, and layer 3 networking.
