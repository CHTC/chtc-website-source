title: Integrating Pytorch and Pelican
type: Software Development
scale: Large
summary: |
  PyTorch is one of the most popular machine learning frameworks.  An important aspect of 
  using it is the data engineering: how is input data fed into the model during training?  
  Going from “tutorial scale” problems to cutting-edge research requires drastically different 
  techniques around data handling.
  
  For this project, we aim to better integrate Pelican into the PyTorch community, providing both
  technical mechanisms (implementing the fsspec interface for Pelican) and documentation by providing
  tutorials and recipes for scaling PyTorch-based training using a combination of HTCondor and Pelican.
