title: High Throughput Inference using CHTC and OSPool
type: Software Development
summary: |
  Advancements in the predictive powers of AI models have led to an expansion in their application and impact in scientific research. An increasing challenge with this rise in utility (and complexity) comes from the desire to leverage these models for enormous volumes of predictions. This project aims to profile technologies and strategies for high throughput inference, using the computing resources available in [CHTC](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) and the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html#:~:text=The%20OSPool%20is%20a%20source,with%20a%20US%20academic%20institution.) to tackle these predictive tasks at enormous scale. By conducting experiments to measure overall performance of these approaches, we aim to be able to provide users guidance and insight into how best to leverage powerful models in their research. These explorations will include strategies for efficient model and data movement, batch processing, data splitting, and may include additional experiments into distributed inference, NVIDIA technologies (Triton, Multi-Process Service), and additional state-of-the-art AI inference technologies.

  #### Project Objectives:

  -   Define a benchmark inference task using a model and dataset
  -   Design a set of experiments to measure inference performance, focusing on overall throughput, resource utilization, efficiency, and scalability.
  -   Profile variants of the inference task, comparing several approaches:
      -   Baseline
      -   Data movement via [Pelican](https://pelicanplatform.org/)
      -   Data splitting and distribution across multiple execution points
      -   Leveraging external software or advanced runtime configuration (NVIDIA Triton, Multi-Process Service (MPS), HuggingFaceâ€™s Accelerate)
  -   Create documentation, tutorials, and guides to inform CHTC and OSPool users of recommended practices.


  #### Prerequisite skills or education:

  -   Familiarity with machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, Tensorflow), preferred
  -   Familiarity with [HTCondor](https://htcondor.com/), preferred
