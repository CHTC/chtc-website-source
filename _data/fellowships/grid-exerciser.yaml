title: Grid Exerciser
scale: Large
type: Software Development
summary: |
  The OSPool is a very large, very dynamic, heterogeneous high throughput system composed of execute
  points from dozens of campuses all over the United States. Sometimes, something will go wrong
  at one of these many sites, or one network, or one storage point, and it is difficult to determine
  where the problem is. This project proposed the design and construction of a “Grid Exerciser”,
  which consists of intentionally sending sample jobs to targeted locations on the OSPool to verify
  correct operation and sufficient performance.  The project will also have a reporting and
  visualization component so that the voluminous results can be understood by a human in a
  concise manner.
