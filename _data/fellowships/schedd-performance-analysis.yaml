title: Schedd performance analysis for humans
scale: Large
type: Software Development
summary: |
  The condor_schedd is a single threaded program, and when it is overloaded, 
  it is difficult for administrators to understand why.  There are some
  statistics about what it is doing, but there is no clear way to present
  this information in a useful way to an administrator. Students working 
  on this project would build visualizations of complex data, and work
  with end users and facilitators to tune output for real world human 
  consumption.
