title: User interface and Jupyter widgets
type: Software Development
summary: |
  Historically, the User Interface to HTCondor has been purely through the command-line. 
  This often presents a large hurdle for onboarding new users, both in terms of even 
  getting to the command-line via ssh and some terminal emulator, and then using the 
  command line.  Modern notebook interfaces, such as Jupyter have allowed us to minimize
  the first problem, by providing a web interface to the terminal.  However, users still
  need to type in commands to access the batch system.  This project extends HTCondor by
  implementing various Jupyter UI widgets to visualize usersâ€™ jobs within the system, and
  further interface with the system.  After completing this project, the student will have
  Jupyter widgets to show in their portfolio, professional JavaScript experience, and 
  understanding of how a distributed High Throughput System works.
