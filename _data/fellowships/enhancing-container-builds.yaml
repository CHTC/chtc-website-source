title: Enhancing container image build system
scale: Medium
type: Software Development
summary: |
  Container images are a widely used technology to package and distribute 
  software and services for use in systems such as Docker or Kubernetes.
  The PATh project builds hundreds of these images on a weekly basis but 
  the build system needs improvement to support more images and additional
  use cases. This project will focus on taking the existing system and 
  adding configurable, per-image build options. After a successful summer,
  the student fellow will gain skills in Docker containers, GitHub actions, and Bash.
