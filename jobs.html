                If advancing the state of the art of distributed computing in an
                academic environment interests you, the Center for High Throughput
                Computing (CHTC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) offers a
                unique working environment. Our project’s home is in the UW Department
                of Computer Sciences, an internationally recognized department
                consistently ranked in the top ten across the USA. A position with CHTC
                will provide you the opportunity to interact with both department
                faculty and students to translate novel ideas into real-world solutions.
                The software and infrastructure you will be working on is used by
                scientists and engineers at hundreds of institutions, from universities
                to national laboratories and from large high tech corporations to small
                animation teams.

                The CHTC is home to a large distributed campus infrastructure that helps
                scientists on and off campus advance their research. We also develop the
